# IV.  Variables
---

    - Describe each variable that you will measure. You do not need to include any variables that you plan on collecting if they are not going to be included in the confirmatory analyses of this study.

    - Outcome measures (specific measure, scale/range of measure, which subscale/component of measure you will use): 

    - Predictor measures (specific measure, scale/range of measure, which subscale/component of measure you will use):

    - Covariate measures (specific measure, scale/range of measure, which subscale/component of measure you will use):

    - How was behavioral task performance measured (if task fMRI; e.g., response time, accuracy)?

    - Contingency plans for behavioral analysis (e.g., plans if x% of behavioral data is missing; poor variability in behavioral measure). 

    `e.g.:` If the X questionnaire is missing for more than 10% of participants we will not use it or if X 	does not show variability in response (either ceiling or floor effects) in which we cannot look at 	behavioral pattern of interest, we will not use that questionnaire and use Y questionnaire instead.

## 1. Independent variables

---
## 2. Dependent variables

---
## 3. Covariates / Moderators

---
## 4. Indices

Derived indices from fMRI data
`e.g.:`Contrast masks and how they were obtained.

This is an optional section, and depending on the information covered in the previous sections it might be unnecessary.

## 5. Additional operational definitions

Region Specificity (e.g., defined based on anatomical definition, Prior study cluster, Neurosynth definition (make sure to be specific here!), Parcellation definition)

Any other definitions used across study: (e.g., how is “risk” defined; how was “depressed”)
