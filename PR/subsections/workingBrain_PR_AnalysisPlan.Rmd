##Â Analysis Plan

### Brain imaging data. (Actually - not quite sure this is needed here; I think maybe for the next registration instead)

Details regarding the brain imaging parameters and procedure, as well as data pre-processing pipeline implemented for the imaging data can be found in the official imaging documentation (https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/crystal/docs/brain_mri.pdf) and the extended acquisition documentation (https://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/ukbiobank/protocol/V4_23092014.pdf).
