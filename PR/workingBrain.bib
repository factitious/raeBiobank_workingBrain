abstract = {Psychophysiology measures physiological activities originating from the autonomic nervous system, including eye movement, heart rate, electromyography, and skin conductance resistance, while operators conduct behavioral tasks. Researchers have distinguished psychophysiology from neuroergonomics, the latter of which focuses on neural activities in brain functions using brain imaging techniques. Psychophysiology has served as a supplementary measure for representing indicators of the neural activity levels involved in physical and cognitive work. In affective ergonomics, however, the brain's subcortical pathways play a key role, making it difficult to depend solely on the brain imaging techniques used in industrial task settings to quantify and predict human performance. In this chapter, the authors review and compare the strengths and weaknesses of psychophysiology metrics and their applications to cognitive/affective engineering.},

abstract = {Poor sleep quality due to sleep disorders and sleep loss is highly prevalent in the modern society. Underlying mechanisms show that stress is involved in the relationship between sleep and metabolism through hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation. Sleep deprivation and sleep disorders are associated with maladaptive changes in the HPA axis, leading to neuroendocrine dysregulation. Excess of glucocorticoids increase glucose and insulin and decrease adiponectin levels. Thus, this review provides overall view of the relationship between sleep, stress, and metabolism from basic physiology to pathological conditions, highlighting effective treatments for metabolic disturbances.},

abstract = {Background: The effect of shift work on impairment of cognition in later life has not yet been sufficiently investigated. Therefore, we aimed at testing the feasibility of a large-scale epidemiologic study examining this putative association in a pilot study. Methods: Between January and April 2017, a cross-sectional study invited a random sample of 425 former and current employees of a German university hospital aged 55 years and older to undergo a cognitive test battery (including the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status, Trail Making Test, Letter-Number Span, and Vocabulary Test) and to complete a self-administered questionnaire on socio-demographic characteristics, chronotype, sleep, occupational history including shift work, and medical history. Fifty percent of the invitees were registered in the hospital's occupational records as currently working or having worked in a shift system. The feasibility of a large-scale study was evaluated by the response of the study sample and the completeness of data. In addition, we calculated the prevalence of shift work and cognitive impairment in the study population. Results: Seventy five subjects (18{\%}) completed the questionnaire, of whom 47 (11{\%} of the total sample) participated in cognitive testing. In all but four items assessed in the questionnaire, the proportion of missing data was below 10 {\%}, suggesting that the quality of collected data can be considered as high. Eighty percent of the participants reported that they ever worked in a shift system, indicating selective participation by exposure to shift work. With respect to chronotype, the majority of the study subjects rated themselves as rather evening type, while a quarter considered themselves as definite morning type. All cognitive tests could be carried out completely. We observed slight difficulties in at least one of the cognitive tests in 17 participants (36{\%}) while two participants (4{\%}) showed more pronounced signs of cognitive impairment. Conclusion: The present pilot study only partially supported the feasibility of the planned large-scale study. As response rates were low and depended on exposure to shift work, a better way of sampling and recruitment needs to be identified. The questionnaire and the test battery appear to be viable instruments.},

abstract = {The current meta-analytic review evaluated the effects of experimentally manipulated sleep restriction on neurocognitive functioning. Random-effects models were employed to estimate the overall effect size and the differential effect size across cognitive domains. Age, time of day, age-adjusted sleep deficit, cumulative days of restricted sleep, sleep latency, subjective sleepiness, and biological sex were examined as potential moderators of the effect. Based on a sample of 61 studies, from 71 different populations, findings revealed a significant negative effect of sleep restriction on cognitive processing across cognitive domains (g = −0.383, p {\textless} 0.001). This effect held for executive functioning (g = −0.324, p {\textless} 0.001), sustained attention (g = −0.409, p {\textless} 0.001), and long-term memory (g = −0.192, p = 0.002). There was insufficient evidence to detect an effect within the domains of attention, multitask, impulsive decision-making or intelligence. Age group, time of day, cumulative days of restricted sleep, sleep latency, subjective sleepiness, and biological sex were all significant moderators of the overall effect. In conclusion, the current meta-analysis is the first comprehensive review to provide evidence that short-term sleep restriction significantly impairs waking neurocognitive functioning.},

abstract = {Objectives Long working hours and precarious employment are relatively common in South Korea. Since both can impact on mental health, this study examined their independent and combined effects on depressive symptoms of employees. Methods Data were from the Korean Welfare Panel Study (KOWEPS), 2010-2013. A total of 2733 full-time employees without depressive symptoms were analysed. Hierarchical logistic regression models were used to investigate the effect of the number of working hours per week (eg, 35-40 hours, 41-52 hours, 53-68 hours, and {\textgreater}68 hours) and employment status (permanent vs precarious employment) on depressive symptoms, measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) 11 scale. Results Compared with individuals working 35-40 hours/week, employees working above 68 hours (OR 1.57, 95{\%} CI 1.05 to 2.34) had higher odds of depressive symptoms after full adjustment. Similarly, precarious employees (OR 1.34, 95{\%} CI 1.02 to 1.75) showed worse mental health than permanent employees. In the combined effect model, employees in precarious employment who worked above 68 hours/ week (OR, 2.03 95{\%} CI 1.08 to 3.83) exhibited the highest odds of depressive symptoms compared with permanent employees working 35 to 40 hours/week. Conclusions Long work hours and precarious employment status were associated with higher odds of depressive symptoms. The findings highlight the importance of monitoring and addressing the vulnerable groups of employees to reduce the mental health burden of economically active individuals.},

abstract = {Introduction: Shift work is known to disrupt workers' normal circadian rhythms and social life, and to be associated with increased health problems. In contrast to the considerable literature regarding attention in shift work, evidence for the impact of shift work on brain functional imaging is limited. The aim of this study was to compare sleep quality and quantity, which was measured by actigraphy, between shift workers (SW) and day workers (SW). Secondly, we performed comparisons of perfusion brain MRI between two groups. Methods: Ten DW and 10 SW (all female nurses, mean age 35.1 y) were enrolled. Measures of habitual sleep were obtained from two weeks of wrist actigraphy for determination of total sleep time (TST), sleep latency (SL), sleep efficiency (SE), minutes of wakefulness after sleep onset (WASO), and sleep fragmentation. We compared demographics, emotional states (mood and anxiety), insomnia severity, daytime sleepiness and automated battery of psychometric measures between two groups. The perfusional differences of regional brain were measured in the morning in after finishing night shifts in SW and in the afternoon in DW. Results: SW was associated with higher anxiety (HADS-A score 8.0 +/- 3.3 vs. 4.7 +/- 2.6, p=0.024) and depressive mood (HADS-D score 9.5 +/- 3.2 vs. 5.6 +/- 4.5, p=0.039) and reported more severe insomnia (ISI score 13.9 +/- 4.7 vs. 4.7 +/- 3.5, p{\textless}0.001) than day worker. Shift workers' actigraphy showed that total sleep time was different depending on their work schedule, less sleep time during night shift(287.1 +/- 148.7 vs. 400.9 +/- 105.6, 365.6 +/- 100.1,382.0 +/- 96.8, p{\textless}0.001; day shift, evening shift and DW respectively). There was no significant difference when it comes to SE, SL and WASO between SW and DW. SW showed increased mean transit time at right inferior frontal gyrus, left cerebellum, left parahippocampal gyrus, right insula and left superior occipital gyrus compared to SW. neurocognitive performance showed no significant difference between two groups Conclusion: The findings may reflect the disruption of the SW's sleep-wake cycles resulting in anxiety and depressive mood. Perfusion MRI finding suggests the early functional changes in the brains of SW.},

abstract = {Background: Sleep duration has been implicated in the etiology of obesity but less is known about the association between sleep and other behavioral risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Purpose: The aim of this study was to examine the associations among sleep duration, chronotype, and physical activity, screen-based sedentary behavior, tobacco use, and dietary intake. Methods: Regression models were used to examine sleep duration and chronotype as the predictors and cardiovascular risk factors as outcomes of interest in a cross-sectional sample of 439,933 adults enrolled in the UK Biobank project. Results: Short sleepers were 45 {\%} more likely to smoke tobacco than adequate sleepers (9.8 vs. 6.9 {\%}, respectively). Late chronotypes were more than twice as likely to smoke tobacco than intermediate types (14.9 vs. 7.4 {\%}, respectively). Long sleepers reported 0.61 more hours of television per day than adequate sleepers. Early chronotypes reported 0.20 fewer daily hours of computer use per day than intermediate chronotypes. Early chronotypes had 0.25 more servings of fruit and 0.13 more servings of vegetables per day than late chronotypes. Conclusions: Short and long sleep duration and late chronotype are associated with greater likelihood of cardiovascular risk behaviors. Further work is needed to determine whether these findings are maintained in the context of objective sleep and circadian estimates, and in more diverse samples. The extent to which promoting adequate sleep duration and earlier sleep timing improves heart health should also be examined prospectively.},

@article{Costa2006,
abstract = {Flexible working hours can have several meanings and can be arranged in a number of ways to suit the worker and/or employer. Two aspects of "flexible" arrangement of working hours were considered: one more subjected to company control and decision (variability) and one more connected to individual discretion and autonomy (flexibility). The aim of the study was to analyze these two dimensions in relation to health and well-being, taking into consideration the interaction with some relevant background variables related to demographics plus working and social conditions. The dataset of the Third European Survey on working conditions, conducted in 2000 and involving 21,505 workers, was used. Nineteen health disorders and four psycho-social conditions were tested by means of multiple logistic regression analysis, in which mutually adjusted odds ratios were calculated for age, gender, marital status, number of children, occupation, mode of employment, shift work, night work, time pressure, mental and physical workload, job satisfaction, and participation in work organization. The flexibility and variability of working hours appeared inversely related to health and psycho-social well-being: the most favorable effects were associated with higher flexibility and lower variability. The analysis of the interactions with the twelve intervening variables showed that physical work, age, and flexibility are the three most important factors affecting health and well-being. Flexibility resulted as the most important factor to influence work satisfaction; the second to affect family and social commitment and the ability to do the same job when 60 years old, as well as trauma, overall fatigue, irritability, and headache; and the third to influence heart disease, stomachache, anxiety, injury, and the feeling that health being at risk because of work. Variability was the third most important factor influencing family and social commitments. Moreover, shift and night work confirmed to have a significant influence on sleep, digestive and cardiovascular troubles, as well and health and safety at work. Time pressure also showed a relevant influence, both on individual stress and social life. Therefore, suitable arrangements of flexible working time, aimed at supporting workers' coping strategies, appear to have a clear beneficial effect on worker health and well-being, with positive consequences also at the company and social level, as evidenced by the higher "feeling to be able to work until 60 years of age".

abstract = {There are increasing reports of cognitive and psychological declines related to occupational stress in subjects without psychiatric premorbidity or major life trauma. The underlying neurobiology is unknown, and many question the notion that the described disabilities represent a medical condition. Using PET we recently found that persons suffering from chronic occupational stress had limbic reductions in the 5-HT1A receptor binding potential. Here we examine whether chronic work-related stress is also associated with changes in brain structure. We performed MRI-based voxel-based morphometry and structural volumetry in stressed subjects and unstressed controls focusing on gray (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes, and the volumes of hippocampus, caudate, and putamen - structures known to be susceptible to neurotoxic changes. Stressed subjects exhibited significant reductions in the GM volumes of the anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, their caudate and putamen volumes were reduced, and the volumes correlated inversely to the degree of perceived stress. Our results add to previous data on chronic psychosocial stress, and indicate a morphological involvement of the frontostriatal circuits. The present findings of morphological changes in these regions confirm our previous conclusion that symptoms from occupational stress merit careful investigations and targeted treatment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Blix et al.},

abstract = {Background and Purpose Shift work disrupts the body's circadian rhythms and increases the risk of health problems. Despite evidence of neuropsychological disturbances in shift workers (SW), the brain functional status as measured by brain perfusion in chronic shift work has not been evaluated previously. We investigated the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in SW using perfusion MRI (pMRI) and evaluated the relationships between altered rCBF and sleep, mood, psychometric measures, and quality of life. Methods Fifteen rotational SW and 15 day workers (DW) were enrolled. The participants were all female nurses working at a university-affiliated hospital. During 2 weeks of actigraphy they underwent pMRI scanning and psychometric testing on the last day immediately after working. Demographic characteristics, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and mood were compared between the groups. Results The participants were aged 35.3±2.9 years (mean±SD) and had been performing their current work for more than 2 years. The demographic characteristics did not differ between SW and DW, but the levels of insomnia, anxiety, depression, and hyperactivity-restless-ness in psychometric measures were higher in SW than in DW. Cerebral perfusion in SW was significantly decreased in the cuneus, fusiform/parahippocampal gyri, and cerebellum of the right hemisphere, while it was increased in the inferior occipital gyrus of the left hemisphere. Perfusion changes in SW were significantly correlated with depression and insomnia severity. The onset and duration irregularity of sleep among SW were related to insomnia, mood, hyper-activity/restlessness, and quality of life. Conclusions SW experience considerably more insomnia and mood disturbances than do DW, and this is significantly related to perfusion changes in multiple brain areas.},

abstract = {Objectives A 25{\%} reduction of weekly work hours for full-time employees has been shown to improve sleep and alertness and reduce stress during both workdays and days off. The aim of the present study was to investigate how employees use their time during such an intervention: does total workload (paid and non-paid work) decrease, and recovery time increase, when work hours are reduced? Methods Full-time employees within the public sector (n=636; 75{\%} women) were randomised into intervention group and control group. The intervention group (n=370) reduced worktime to 75{\%} with preserved salary during 18 months. Data were collected at baseline, after 9 months and 18 months. Time-use was reported every half-hour daily between 06:00 and 01:00 during 1 week at each data collection. Data were analysed with multilevel mixed modelling. Results Compared with the control group, the intervention group increased the time spent on domestic work and relaxing hobby activities during workdays when worktime was reduced (P{\textless}0.001). On days off, more time was spent in free-time activities (P=0.003). Total workload decreased (-65min) and time spent in recovery activities increased on workdays (+53 min). The pattern of findings was similar in subgroups defined by gender, family status and job situation. Conclusions A worktime reduction of 25{\%} for full-time workers resulted in decreased total workload and an increase of time spent in recovery activities, which is in line with the suggestion that worktime reduction may be beneficial for long-term health and stress.},

Work {\textless}-{\textgreater} Wellbeing (i.e. recovery activities)

Interventional study. Same data as the 2017 study.

Relevance:

- Importance of recovery activities for well being. 
-{\textgreater} The Basner papers find that relative to all other waking activities, paid work time was the primary waking activity exchanged for sleep. First, their recommandations for increasing sleep time: delay morning start time of work/educational activities. No mention of time spent at work. Second, the follow-up paper finds that some groups show a significant increase in sleep duration across (survey) years either on weekdays or weekends, i.e. employed adults, full time students and retirees (interestingly not for those who are unemployed or not in the labour force). They conclude that the change is predominantly explained by respondents retiring eariler in the evening: participants seem more willing to trade waking activities for sleep. 
- Based on the link that this present paper is establishing between recovery activities and wellbeing, the groups isolated in the Basner follow-up paper are trading the wrong waking activities in exchange for sleep.

- Hmm, no difference in the effects of reduced worktime depending on job nature (e.g. shift workers).

Working patters {\textless}-{\textgreater} Wellbeing (i.e. recovery activities)

Interventional study. Same data as the 2017 study.

Relevance:

- Importance of recovery activities for well being. 
-{\textgreater} The Basner papers find that relative to all other waking activities, paid work time was the primary waking activity exchanged for sleep. First, their recommandations for increasing sleep time: delay morning start time of work/educational activities. No mention of time spent at work. Second, the follow-up paper finds that some groups show a significant increase in sleep duration across (survey) years either on weekdays or weekends, i.e. employed adults, full time students and retirees (interestingly not for those who are unemployed or not in the labour force). They conclude that the change is predominantly explained by respondents retiring eariler in the evening: participants seem more willing to trade waking activities for sleep. 
- Based on the link that this present paper is establishing between recovery activities and wellbeing, the groups isolated in the Basner follow-up paper are trading the wrong waking activities in exchange for sleep.

- Hmm, no difference in the effects of reduced worktime depending on job nature (e.g. shift workers).},

abstract = {Long workhours erode health, which the setting of maximum weekly hours aims to avert. This 48-h limit, and the evidence base to support it, has evolved from a workforce that was largely male, whose time in the labour force was enabled by women's domestic work and care giving. The gender composition of the workforce has now changed, and many women (as well as some men) combine care-giving with paid work, a change viewed as fundamental for gender equality. However, it raises questions on the suitability of the work time limit and the extent it is protective of health. We estimate workhour–mental health thresholds, testing if they vary for men and women due to gendered workloads and constraints on and off the job. Using six waves of data from a nationally representative sample of Australian adults (24–65 years), surveyed in the Household Income Labour Dynamics of Australia Survey (N = 3828 men; 4062 women), our study uses a longitudinal, simultaneous equation approach to address endogeneity. Averaging over the sample, we find an overall threshold of 39 h per week beyond which mental health declines. Separate curves then estimate thresholds for men and women, by high or low care and domestic time constraints, using stratified and pooled samples. We find gendered workhour-health limits (43.5 for men, 38 for women) which widen further once differences in resources on and off the job are considered. Only when time is ‘unencumbered' and similar time constraints and contexts are assumed, do gender gaps narrow and thresholds approximate the 48-h limit. Our study reveals limits to contemporary workhour regulation which may be systematically disadvantaging women's health.},

However, its effects on intrinsic low-frequency connectivity within the Default Mode Network (DMN) and its related anti-correlated network (ACN) have not been well characterized. We investigated the effect of SD on functional connectivity within the DMN, and on DMN-ACN anti-correlation, both during the resting state and during performance of a visual attention task (VAT). 26 healthy participants underwent fMRI twice: once after a normal night of sleep in rested wakefulness (RW) and once following approximately 24. h of total SD. A seed-based approach was used to examine pairwise correlations of low-frequency fMRI signal across different nodes in each state. SD was associated with significant selective reductions in DMN functional connectivity and DMN-ACN anti-correlation. This was congruent across resting state and VAT analyses, suggesting that SD induces a robust alteration in the intrinsic connectivity within and between these networks. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Neuroimaging allows for the non-invasive study of the brain in rich detail. Data-driven discovery of patterns of population variability in the brain has the potential to be extremely valuable for early disease diagnosis and understanding the brain. The resulting patterns can be used as imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs), and may complement existing expert-curated IDPs. However, population datasets, comprising many different structural and functional imaging modalities from thousands of subjects, provide a computational challenge not previously addressed. Here, for the first time, a multimodal independent component analysis approach is presented that is scalable for data fusion of voxel-level neuroimaging data in the full UK Biobank (UKB) dataset, that will soon reach 100,000 imaged subjects. This new computational approach can estimate modes of population variability that enhance the ability to predict thousands of phenotypic and behavioural variables using data from UKB and the Human Connectome Project. A high-dimensional decomposition achieved improved predictive power compared with widely-used analysis strategies, single-modality decompositions and existing IDPs. In UKB data (14,503 subjects with 47 different data modalities), many interpretable associations with non-imaging phenotypes were identified, including multimodal spatial maps related to fluid intelligence, handedness and disease, in some cases where IDP-based approaches failed.},

This applies to both musculo-skeletal disorders as well as to psycho-vegetative complaints. The relationship of the duration of the exposure to working conditions to health impairments is moderated by a great number of individual (e.g., age) and situational (e.g., shift-work) variables, showing additive or interactive effects for which selected examples have been presented. In general, however, there is a consistent functional relationship between the number or working hours and their effects on the workers that holds over a great variety of conditions.

abstract = {Much of what we assume about the effects of short sleep duration on neural reward processing derives from total sleep deprivation studies. Although total sleep deprivation appears rare, habitual short sleep is common: 30{\%} of working US adults report habitually sleeping ≤ 6 hours/night. It remains largely unknown whether habitual short sleepers exhibit similar reward processing brain activation patterns to those observed following total sleep deprivation in prior studies. Therefore, our aim was to test objectively reward processing brain activation patterns associated with self-reported habitual short sleep duration in a large sample. Methods: Nine hundred and fifty-two adult participants from the Human Connectome Project database were grouped on reported habitual short (≤6 hours) vs. medium-length (7-9 hours) sleep duration using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Reward processing brain activation was examined using a gambling task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Subject-level covariates for age, sex, continuous sleep duration, daytime dysfunction, and PSQI total score are provided as supplemental analyses. Results: Brain activation patterns revealed expected reward processing-related activation for age and sex. However, activation for sleep duration, dysfunction, and PSQI score did not correspond to those evident in previous total sleep deprivation studies. Conclusions: Self-reported short sleep duration, perceived sleep-related dysfunction, and sleep quality via PSQI do not appear to be meaningfully associated with activation in well-described regions of the human neurobiological reward circuit. As these findings are counter to prior results using experimental sleep deprivation, future work focused on more direct comparisons between self-reported sleep variables and experimental sleep deprivation appears warranted.},

abstract = {The effects of sleep deprivation (SD) on the neural substrates of inhibition control are poorly understood. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the effects of 24 h of SD on cerebral activation during a stop-signal task in 20 normal young subjects. Behaviorally, subjects showed significantly delayed stop-signal reaction time (SSRT) following SD. In addition, reduced cerebral activation was found in the “stopping network” (including the inferior frontal gyrus [IFG], supplementary motor area, subthalamic nucleus [STN] and insula) and vision-related regions (occipital cortex, lingual gyrus and fusiform gyrus) after SD. These findings support the hypothesis that task-related activation in prefrontal cortex is particularly vulnerable to SD. After rested wakefulness (RW), significant negative correlations were found between SSRT and cerebral activation in left IFG, right hippocampus, right lingual gyrus, left STN and bilateral fusiform gyrus, with activation in left IFG making the most contribution. After SD, significant negative correlations were found between SSRT and activation in right middle frontal cortex, right IFG and left lingual gyrus, with the activation in right IFG making the most contribution. Furthermore, we observed significant interaction effects of state (SD or RW) with activation in bilateral IFG, left STN and left lingual gyrus on SSRT. In conclusion, sleep deprivation is associated with the deficits in inhibition-related neural activation and the altered correlation between SSRT and cerebral activation, especially in the bilateral IFG, left STN and left lingual gyrus.},

There are both pro-inflammatory cytokines and anti-inflammatory cytokines. There is significant evidence showing that certain cytokines/chemokines are involved in not only the initiation but also the persistence of pathologic pain by directly activating nociceptive sensory neurons. Certain inflammatory cytokines are also involved in nerve-injury/inflammation-induced central sensitization, and are related to the development of contralateral hyperalgesia/allodynia.

abstract = {Objectives: To inform the debate over whether human sleep can be chronically reduced without consequences, we conducted a dose-response chronic sleep restriction experiment in which waking neurobehavioral and sleep physiological functions were monitored and compared to those for total sleep deprivation. Design: The chronic sleep restriction experiment involved randomization to one of three sleep doses (4 h, 6 h, or 8 h time in bed per night), which were maintained for 14 consecutive days. The total sleep deprivation experiment involved 3 nights without sleep (0 h time in bed). Each study also involved 3 baseline (pre-deprivation) days and 3 recovery days. Setting: Both experiments were conducted under standardized laboratory conditions with continuous behavioral, physiological and medical monitoring. Participants: A total of n = 48 healthy adults (ages 21-38) participated in the experiments. Interventions: Nocturnal sleep periods were restricted to 8 h, 6 h or 4 h per day for 14 days, or to 0 h for 3 days. All other sleep was prohibited. Results: Chronic restriction of sleep periods to 4 h or 6 h per night over 14 consecutive days resulted in significant cumulative, dose-dependent deficits in cognitive performance on all tasks. Subjective sleepiness ratings showed an acute response to sleep restriction but only small further increases on subsequent days, and did not significantly differentiate the 6 h and 4 h conditions. Polysomnographic variables and $\delta$ power in the non-REM sleep EEG - a putative marker of sleep homeostasis - displayed an acute response to sleep restriction with negligible further changes across the 14 restricted nights. Comparison of chronic sleep restriction to total sleep deprivation showed that the latter resulted in disproportionately large waking neurobehavioral and sleep $\delta$ power responses relative to how much sleep was lost. A statistical model revealed that, regardless of the mode of sleep deprivation, lapses in behavioral alertness were near-linearly related to the cumulative duration of wakefulness in excess of 15.84 h (s.e. 0.73 h). Conclusions: Since chronic restriction of sleep to 6 h or less per night produced cognitive performance deficits equivalent to up to 2 nights of total sleep deprivation, it appears that even relatively moderate sleep restriction can seriously impair waking neurobehavioral functions in healthy adults. Sleepiness ratings suggest that subjects were largely unaware of these increasing cognitive deficits, which may explain why the impact of chronic sleep restriction on waking cognitive functions is often assumed to be benign. Physiological sleep responses to chronic restriction did not mirror waking neurobehavioral responses, but cumulative wakefulness in excess of a 15.84 h predicted performance lapses across all four experimental conditions. This suggests that sleep debt is perhaps best understood as resulting in additional wakefulness that has a neurobiological "cost" which accumulates over time.},

abstract = {Objectives: Previous work suggests that sleep restriction (SR) reduces cognitive control and may increase negative implicit biases. Here we investigated whether SR might influence decision making on a social-evaluative task where individuals had to make judgments of threat based on facial photographs. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of changes in negative implicit biases as a result of sleep restriction on this decision-making task. Design: Fourteen healthy adults underwent two 3-week counterbalanced in-laboratory stays (chronic SR and control sleep [CS] conditions). Participants completed the Arab Muslim Names implicit association test (a measure of implicit bias/attitudes toward Arab Muslims) and the Karolinska Airport Task (a measure of explicit decision making). The Karolinska Airport Task requires participants to judge the potential dangerousness of individuals based on facial photographs. Results: After SR, participants were more likely to deem individuals with less positive and more negative facial features as dangerous than after CS. In addition, after SR, those participants showing higher negative implicit bias toward Arab Muslims tended to consider as more dangerous individuals with more quintessentially untrustworthy facial features (r = 0.76, P =.007), whereas this relationship was nonsignificant after CS (r = 0.33, P =.28). Conclusions: These findings show not only that SR may increase implicit biases against a particular minority group but that SR also modifies how individuals make explicit decisions about another's trustworthiness based on facial features. These findings may have important implications for many occupations where workers who are routinely restricted of sleep are also responsible for making judgments about other people's trustworthiness (eg, police, security, military personnel).},

abstract = {The relationship between psychosocial stress at work and mental health outcome is well-known. Brain-imaging studies hypothesize morphological brain modifications connected to work-related stress. To our knowledge this is the first study describing the link between work characteristics and brain imaging in a sample of work-related psychiatric patients assessed according to standardized clinical and diagnostic criteria. The aims of the study are: (1) to evaluate hippocampal and whole brain volumes in work-related psychiatric disturbances; (2) to verify the relationship between brain changes and the anxious and/or depressive symptoms; (3) to observe the relationship between the brain changes and the degree of the bullying at workplace. The hippocampus and whole brain volumes of 23 patients with work-related adjustment-disorders were compared with 15 controls by means of MRI. MR images highlight a smaller hippocampal volume in patients compared with controls. Significant reduction in the patients' gray matter was found in three brain areas: right inferior temporal gyrus, left cuneus, left inferior occipital gyrus. The reduction of the hippocampi volumes was related to work distress and, above all, to bullying at workplace. The results confirm that the morphological brain abnormalities could be involved in work-related psychiatric disturbances.},

abstract = {To determine whether a cumulative sleep debt (in a range commonly experienced) would result in cumulative changes in measures of waking neurobehavioral alertness, 16 healthy young adults had their sleep restricted 33{\%} below habitual sleep duration, to an average 4.98 hours per night [standard deviation (SD) = 0.57] for seven consecutive nights. Subjects slept in the laboratory, and sleep and waking were monitored by staff and actigraphy. Three times each day (1000, 1600, and 2200 hours) subjects were assessed for subjective sleepiness (SSS) and mood (POMS) and were evaluated on a brief performance battery that included psychomotor vigilance (PVT), probed memory (PRM), and serial-addition testing. Once each day they completed a series of visual analog scales (VAS) and reported sleepiness and somatic and cognitive/emotional problems. Sleep restriction resulted in statistically robust cumulative effects on waking functions. SSS ratings, subscale scores for fatigue, confusion, tension, and total mood disturbance from the POMS and VAS ratings of mental exhaustion and stress were elevated across days of restricted sleep (p = 0.009 to p = 0.0001). PVT performance parameters, including the frequency and duration of lapses, were also significantly increased by restriction (p = 0.018 to p = 0.0001). Significant time-of-day effects were evident in SSS and PVT data, but time-of-day did not interact with the effects of sleep restriction across days. The temporal profiles of cumulative changes in neurobehavioral measures of alertness as a function of sleep restriction were generally consistent. Subjective changes tended to precede performance changes by 1 day, but overall changes in both classes of measure were greatest during the first 2 days (PI, P2) and last 2 days (P6, P7) of sleep restriction. Data from subsets of subjects also showed: I) that significant decreases in the MSLT occurred during sleep restriction, 2) that the elevated sleepiness and performance deficits continued beyond day 7 of restriction, and 3) that recovery from these deficits appeared to require two full nights of sleep. The cumulative increase in performance lapses across days of sleep restriction correlated closely with MSLT results (r =-0.95) from an earlier comparable experiment by Carskadon and Dement (1). These findings suggest that cumulative nocturnal sleep debt had a dynamic and escalating analog in cumulative daytime sleepiness and that asymptotic or steady-state sleepiness was not achieved in response to sleep restriction.},

abstract = {Study Objectives: Although there are considerable data demonstrating the impact of shift work on sleep and alertness, little research has examined the prevalence and consequences of shift work sleep disorder in comparison to the difficulties with insomnia and excessive sleepiness experienced by day workers. The present study was designed to determine the relative prevalence and negative consequences associated with shift work sleep disorder in a representative sample drawn from the working population of metropolitan Detroit. Design: Random-digit dialing techniques were used to assess individuals regarding their current work schedules and a variety of sleep- and non-sleep-related outcomes. Setting: Detroit tricounty population. Participants: A total of 2,570 individuals aged 18 to 65 years from a representative community-based sample including 360 people working rotating shifts, 174 people working nights, and 2036 working days. Measurements and Results: Using standardized techniques, individuals were assessed for the presence of insomnia and excessive sleepiness, based on DSM-IV and ICSD criteria. Those individuals with either insomnia or excessive sleepiness and who were currently working rotating or night schedules were classified as having shift work sleep disorder. Occupational, behavioral, and health-related outcomes were also measured. Individuals who met criteria for shift work sleep disorder had significantly higher rates of ulcers (odds ratio = 4.18, 95{\%} confidence interval = 2.00-8.72), sleepiness-related accidents, absenteeism, depression, and missed family and social activities more frequently compared to those shift workers who did not meet criteria (P {\textless} .05). Importantly, in most cases, the morbidity associated with shift work sleep disorder was significantly greater than that experienced by day workers with identical symptoms. Conclusion: These findings suggest that individuals with shift work sleep disorder are at risk for significant behavioral and health-related morbidity associated with their sleep-wake symptomatology. Further, it suggests that the prevalence of shift work sleep disorder is approximately 10{\%} of the night and rotating shift work population.},

abstract = {As a central fear processor of the brain, the amygdala initiates a cascade of critical physiological and behavioral responses. Neuroimaging studies have shown that the human amygdala responds not only to fearful and angry facial expressions but also to fearful and threatening scenes such as attacks, explosions, and mutilations. Given the relative importance of facial expressions in adaptive social behavior, we hypothesized that the human amygdala would exhibit a stronger response to angry and fearful facial expressions in comparison to other fearful and threatening stimuli. Twelve subjects completed two tasks while undergoing fMRI: matching angry or fearful facial expressions, and matching scenes depicting fearful or threatening situations derived from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). While there was an amygdala response to both facial expressions and IAPS stimuli, direct comparison revealed that the amygdala response to facial expressions was significantly greater than that to IAPS stimuli. Autonomic reactivity, measured by skin conductance responses, was also greater to facial expressions. These results suggest that the human amygdala shows a stronger response to affective facial expressions than to scenes, a bias that should be considered in the design of experimental paradigms interested in probing amygdala function.},

abstract = {Sleep deprivation has been shown recently to alter emotional processing possibly associated with reduced frontal regulation. Such impairments can ultimately fail adaptive attempts to regulate emotional processing (also known as cognitive control of emotion), although this hypothesis has not been examined directly. Therefore, we explored the influence of sleep deprivation on the human brain using two different cognitive-emotional tasks, recorded using fMRI and EEG. Both tasks involved irrelevant emotional and neutral distractors presented during a competing cognitive challenge, thus creating a continuous demand for regulating emotional processing. Results reveal that, although participants showed enhanced limbic and electrophysiological reactions to emotional distractors regardless of their sleep state, they were specifically unable to ignore neutral distracting information after sleep deprivation. As a consequence, sleep deprivation resulted in similar processing of neutral and negative distractors, thus disabling accurate emotional discrimination. As expected, these findings were further associated with a decrease in prefrontal connectivity patterns in both EEG and fMRI signals, reflecting a profound decline in cognitive control of emotion. Notably, such a decline was associated with lower REM sleep amounts, supporting a role for REM sleep in overnight emotional processing. Altogether, our findings suggest that losing sleep alters emotional reactivity by lowering the threshold for emotional activation, leading to a maladaptive loss of emotional neutrality.},

abstract = {Sleep deprivation (SD) can degrade cognitive functioning, but growing evidence suggests that there are large individual differences in the vulnerability to this effect. Some evidence suggests that baseline differences in the responsiveness of a fronto-parietal attention system that is activated during working memory (WM) tasks may be associated with the ability to sustain vigilance during sleep deprivation. However, the neurocircuitry underlying this network remains virtually unexplored. In this study, we employed diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate the association between the microstructure of the axonal pathway connecting the frontal and parietal regions-i.e., the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF)-and individual resistance to SD. Thirty healthy participants (15 males) aged 20-43. years underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) at rested wakefulness prior to a 28-hour period of SD. Task-related fronto-parietal fMRI activation clusters during a Sternberg WM Task were localized and used as seed regions for probabilistic fiber tractography. DTI metrics, including fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, axial and radial diffusivity were measured in the SLF. The psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) was used to evaluate resistance to SD. We found that activation in the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) positively correlated with resistance. Higher fractional anisotropy of the left SLF comprising the primary axons connecting IPL and DLPFC was also associated with better resistance. These findings suggest that individual differences in resistance to SD are associated with the functional responsiveness of a fronto-parietal attention system and the microstructural properties of the axonal interconnections.},

Sleep loss and insomnia have been found to affect emotional reactivity and social functioning, although results, taken together, are somewhat contradictory. Here we review this advancing literature, aiming to 1) systematically review the relevant literature on sleep and socio-emotional functioning, with reference to the extant literature on emotion and social interactions, 2) summarize results and outline ways in which emotion, social interactions, and sleep may interact, and 3) suggest key limitations and future directions for this field. From the reviewed literature, sleep deprivation is associated with diminished emotional expressivity and impaired emotion recognition, and this has particular relevance for social interactions. Sleep deprivation also increases emotional reactivity; results which are most apparent with neuro-imaging studies investigating amygdala activity and its prefrontal regulation. Evidence of emotional dysregulation in insomnia and poor sleep has also been reported. In general, limitations of this literature include how performance measures are linked to self-reports, and how results are linked to socio-emotional functioning. We conclude by suggesting some possible future directions for this field.},

Definite eveningness was significantly associated with increased odds for probable lifetime depression after controlling for a number of confounding factors including neuroticism.

Design: Observational study of UK Biobank participants recruited between 2006-2010. Repeat assessments in subsets of the sample between 2012-2013 and 2014-2019. Setting: United Kingdom. Participants: 502,521 men and women, aged 37-73. Main outcome measures: 81 cancer and 443 non-cancer illnesses to classify participants by health status (non-standard risk/standard risk). Long-standing illness (yes/no) and self-rated health (poor/fair/good/excellent) constituted secondary outcomes. Results: 307,378 participants (mean age = 56.1 years, SD = 8.07; 51.91{\%} female) selected for cross-sectional analyses. 16,058 and 32,617 participants selected for longitudinal analyses of self-rated health. Lower annual household income (OR = 0.74, 95{\%} CI 0.726 to 0.764 [{\textless}GBP18000 vs GBP31000-51999]), higher levels of neighbourhood deprivation (OR = 0.995, 95{\%} CI 0.995 to 0.996), being male (OR = 0.88, 95{\%} CI 0.870 to 0.899), loneliness (OR = 0.81, 95{\%} CI 0.786 to 0.840) and social isolation (OR = 0.95, 95{\%} CI 0.923 to 0.977) was associated with poor health. Walking more frequently (OR = 1.01, 95{\%} CI 1.006 to 1.015) and engaging more frequently in vigorous physical activity (OR = 1.03, 95{\%}CI 1.027 to 1.037) was associated with favourable health, whereas higher body mass index (OR = 0.968, 95{\%}CI 0.967 to 0.970) and smoking (OR = 0.75, 95{\%}CI 0.731-0.773 [current vs never]) was associated with poor health. Infrequent alcohol intake was associated with poor health (OR = 0.91, 95{\%} CI 0.887 to 0.940 [1-3 times/month vs 1-2 times/week]), whereas a more frequent drinking pattern was associated with favourable health (OR = 1.06, 95{\%} CI 1.035 to 1.084 [3-4 times/week vs 1-2 times/week]). There was some evidence that higher levels of airborne pollutants (PM2.5, PM10 and NO2) and noise (Lden) were associated with poor health, though findings were inconsistent after adjustment for other factors. Neighbourhood greenspace percentage was associated with positive self-rated health. Conclusions: Public health medicine could put greater focus on non-medical factors, such as loneliness, further encourage healthy lifestyle behaviours and weight management, and examine efforts to improve health outcomes of individuals in the lowest income groups. {\#}{\#}{\#} Competing Interest Statement JM receives studentship funding from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) and Eli Lilly and Company Limited; CML is a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of Myriad Neuroscience. {\#}{\#}{\#} Funding Statement JM gratefully acknowledges current funding from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) (ref: 2050702) and Eli Lilly and Company Limited in support of this work.

Here, we attempt to summarize studies looking at the effects of sleep pressure, circadian variations, and chronotype on cognitive functioning in healthy subjects. The picture that emerges from this assessment is that beyond physiological variables, time-of-day modulations affect performance on a wide range of cognitive tasks measuring attentional capacities, executive functioning, and memory. These performance fluctuations are also contingent upon the chronotype, which reflects interindividual differences in circadian preference, and particularly upon the synchronicity between the individuals' peak periods of circadian arousal and the time of the day at which testing occurs. In themselves, these conclusions should direct both the clinician's and the researcher's attention towards the utmost importance to account for time-of-day parameters when assessing cognitive performance in patients and healthy volunteers.},

abstract = {Background The relationship between inadequate sleep and mood has been well-established in adults and is supported primarily by correlational data in younger populations. Given that adolescents often experience shortened sleep on school nights, we sought to better understand the effect of experimentally induced chronic sleep restriction on adolescents' mood and mood regulation. Methods Fifty healthy adolescents, ages 14-17, completed a 3-week sleep manipulation protocol involving a baseline week, followed by a sleep restriction (SR) condition (6.5 hr in bed per night for five nights) and healthy sleep duration (HS) condition (10 hr in bed per night for five nights). The study used a randomized, counterbalanced, crossover experimental design. Participants' sleep was monitored at home via self-report and actigraphy. At the end of each condition, participants and their parents completed questionnaires of mood and mood regulation. To assess for expectancy effects, we also analyzed parent and teen ratings of hyperactivity/impulsivity, which prior research suggests is not sensitive to SR in adolescents. Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests compared questionnaire outcomes across the two conditions. Results Participants averaged 2.5 more hours of sleep per night during HS relative to SR. Compared with HS, adolescents rated themselves as significantly more tense/anxious, angry/hostile, confused, and fatigued, and as less vigorous (p =.001-.01) during SR. Parents and adolescents also reported greater oppositionality/irritability and poorer emotional regulation during SR compared with HS (p {\textless}.05). There were no cross-condition differences in depression or hyperactivity/impulsivity (p {\textgreater}.05). Conclusions Findings complement prior correlational study results to show that after only a few days of shortened sleep, at a level of severity that is experienced regularly by millions of adolescents on school nights, adolescents have worsened mood and decreased ability to regulate negative emotions. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

abstract = {To date, studies investigating the consequences of shiftwork have predominantly focused on external (local) time. Here, we report the daily variation in cognitive performance in rotating shiftworkers under real-life conditions using the psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) and show that this function depends both on external and internal (biological) time. In addition to this high sensitivity of PVT performance to time-of-day, it has also been extensively applied in sleep deprivation protocols. We, therefore, also investigated the impact of shift-specific sleep duration and time awake on performance. In two separate field studies, 44 young workers (17 females, 27 males; age range 20-36 yrs) performed a PVT test every 2 h during each shift. We assessed chronotype by the MCTQ Shift (Munich ChronoType Questionnaire for shiftworkers). Daily sleep logs over the 4-wk study period allowed for the extraction of shift-specific sleep duration and time awake in a given shift, as well as average sleep duration ("sleep need"). Median reaction times (RTs) significantly varied across shifts, depending on both Local Time and Internal Time. Variability of reaction times around the 24 h mean (≈ ±5{\%}) was best explained by a regression model comprising both factors, Local Time and Internal Time (p {\textless} .001). Short (15th percentile; RT 15{\%}) and long (85th percentile; RT 85{\%}) reaction times were differentially affected by Internal Time and Local Time. During night shifts, only median RT and RT 85{\%} were impaired by the duration of time workers had been awake (p {\textless} .01, consistent with the highest sleep pressure), but not RT 15{\%}. Proportion of sleep before a test day (relative to sleep need) significantly affected median RT and RT 85{\%} during morning shifts (p {\textless} .01). RT 15{\%} was worst in the beginning of the morning shift, but improved to levels above average with increasing time awake (p {\textless} .05), whereas RT 85{\%} became worse (p {\textless} .05). Hierarchical mixed models confirmed the importance of chronotype and sleep duration on cognitive performance in shiftworkers, whereas the effect of time awake requires further research. Our finding that both Local Time and Internal Time, in conjunction with shift-specific sleep behavior, strongly influence performance extends predictions derived from laboratory studies.

abstract = {Background: Sleep restriction, leading to deprivation of sleep, is common in modern 24-h societies and is associated with the development of health problems including cardiovascular diseases. Our objective was to investigate the immunological effects of prolonged sleep restriction and subsequent recovery sleep, by simulating a working week and following recovery weekend in a laboratory environment. Methods and Findings: After 2 baseline nights of 8 hours time in bed (TIB), 13 healthy young men had only 4 hours TIB per night for 5 nights, followed by 2 recovery nights with 8 hours TIB. 6 control subjects had 8 hours TIB per night throughout the experiment. Heart rate, blood pressure, salivary cortisol and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured after the baseline (BL), sleep restriction (SR) and recovery (REC) period. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected at these time points, counted and stimulated with PHA. Cell proliferation was analyzed by thymidine incorporation and cytokine production by ELISA and RT-PCR. CRP was increased after SR (145{\%} of BL; p {\textless} 0.05), and continued to increase after REC (231{\%} of BL; p{\textless}0.05). Heart rate was increased after REC (108{\%} of BL; p{\textless}0.05). The amount of circulating NK-cells decreased (65{\%} of BL; p{\textless}0.005) and the amount of B-cells increased (121{\%} of BL; p{\textless}0.005) after SR, but these cell numbers recovered almost completely during REC. Proliferation of stimulated PBMC increased after SR (233{\%} of BL; p{\textless}0.05), accompanied by increased production of IL-1$\beta$ (137{\%} of BL; p{\textless}0.05), IL-6 (163{\%} of BL; p{\textless}0.05) and IL-17 (138{\%} of BL; p{\textless}0.05) at mRNA level. After REC, IL-17 was still increased at the protein level (119{\%} of BL; p{\textless}0.05). Conclusions: 5 nights of sleep restriction increased lymphocyte activation and the production of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-1$\beta$ IL-6 and IL-17; they remained elevated after 2 nights of recovery sleep, accompanied by increased heart rate and serum CRP, 2 important risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, long-term sleep restriction may lead to persistent changes in the immune system and the increased production of IL-17 together with CRP may increase the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. {\textcopyright} 2009 van Leeuwen et al.},

abstract = {Background UK Biobank is a well-characterised cohort of over 500 000 participants that offers unique opportunities to investigate multiple diseases and risk factors. Aims An online mental health questionnaire completed by UK Biobank participants was expected to expand the potential for research into mental disorders. Method An expert working group designed the questionnaire, using established measures where possible, and consulting with a patient group regarding acceptability. Case definitions were defined using operational criteria for lifetime depression, mania, anxiety disorder, psychotic-like experiences and self-harm, as well as current post-traumatic stress and alcohol use disorders. Results 157 366 completed online questionnaires were available by August 2017. Comparison of self-reported diagnosed mental disorder with a contemporary study shows a similar prevalence, despite respondents being of higher average socioeconomic status than the general population across a range of indicators. Thirty-five per cent (55 750) of participants had at least one defined syndrome, of which lifetime depression was the most common at 24{\%} (37 434). There was extensive comorbidity among the syndromes. Mental disorders were associated with high neuroticism score, adverse life events and long-term illness; addiction and bipolar affective disorder in particular were associated with measures of deprivation. Conclusions The questionnaire represents a very large mental health survey in itself, and the results presented here show high face validity, although caution is needed owing to selection bias. Built into UK Biobank, these data intersect with other health data to offer unparalleled potential for crosscutting biomedical research involving mental health.

abstract = {Objectives: Recent neuroimaging studies have identified a potentially critical role of the amygdala in disrupted emotion neurocircuitry in individuals after total sleep deprivation (TSD). However, connectivity between the amygdala and cerebral cortex due to TSD remains to be elucidated. In this study, we used resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) to investigate the functional connectivity changes of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and centromedial amygdala (CMA) in the brain after 36 h of TSD.
Materials and Methods: Fourteen healthy adult men aged 25.9±2.3 years (range, 18-28 years) were enrolled in a within-subject crossover study. Using the BLA and CMA as separate seed regions, we examined resting-state functional connectivity with fMRI during rested wakefulness (RW) and after 36 h of TSD.
Results: TSD resulted in a significant decrease in the functional connectivity between the BLA and several executive control regions (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [DLPFC], right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex [ACC], right inferior frontal gyrus [IFG]). Increased functional connectivity was found between the BLA and areas including the left posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus (PCC/PrCu) and right parahippocampal gyrus. With regard to CMA, increased functional connectivity was observed with the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and right precentral gyrus.
Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that disturbance in amygdala related circuits may contribute to TSD psychophysiology and suggest that functional connectivity studies of the amygdala during the resting state may be used to discern aberrant patterns of coupling within these circuits after TSD.},

This common sleep pattern was experimentally modeled with three weeks of 5 nights of sleep restricted to 4 h followed by two nights of 8-h recovery sleep. In an intra-individual design, 14 healthy adults completed both the sleep restriction and an 8-h control condition, and the subjective impact and the effects on physiological markers of stress (cortisol, the inflammatory marker IL-6, glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity) were assessed. Sleep restriction was not perceived to be subjectively stressful and some degree of resilience or resistance to the effects of sleep restriction was observed in subjective domains. In contrast, physiological stress response systems remain activated with repeated exposures to sleep restriction and limited recovery opportunity. Morning IL-6 expression in monocytes was significantly increased during week 2 and 3 of sleep restriction, and remained increased after recovery sleep in week 2 (p {\textless} 0.05) and week 3 (p {\textless} 0.09). Serum cortisol showed a significantly dysregulated 24 h-rhythm during weeks 1, 2, and 3 of sleep restriction, with elevated morning cortisol, and decreased cortisol in the second half of the night. Glucocorticoid sensitivity of monocytes was increased, rather than decreased, during the sleep restriction and sleep recovery portion of each week. These results suggest a disrupted interplay between the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and inflammatory systems in the context of repeated exposure to sleep restriction and recovery.

They showed that long workhours are associated with adverse health as measured by several indicators (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, disability retirement, subjectively reported physical health, subjective fatigue). Furthermore, some evidence exists for an association between long workhours and physiological changes (cardiovascular and immunologic parameters) and changes in health-related behavior (reduced sleep hours). Support for the physiological recovery mechanism seems stronger than support for the behavioral lifestyle mechanism. However, the evidence is inconclusive because many studies did not control for potential confounders.

abstract = {Humans show large differences in the preferred timing of their sleep and activity. This so-called "chronotype" is largely regulated by the circadian clock. Both genetic variations in clock genes and environmental influences contribute to the distribution of chronotypes in a given population, ranging from extreme early types to extreme late types with the majority falling between these extremes. Social (e.g., school and work) schedules interfere considerably with individual sleep preferences in the majority of the population. Late chronotypes show the largest differences in sleep timing between work and free days leading to a considerable sleep debt on work days, for which they compensate on free days. The discrepancy between work and free days, between social and biological time, can be described as 'social jetlag.' Here, we explore how sleep quality and psychological wellbeing are associated with individual chronotype and/or social jetlag. A total of 501 volunteers filled out the Munich ChronoType Questionnaire (MCTQ) as well as additional questionnaires on: (i) sleep quality (SF-A), (ii) current psychological wellbeing (Basler Befindlichkeitsbogen), (iii) retrospective psychological wellbeing over the past week (POMS), and (iv) consumption of stimulants (e.g., caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol). Associations of chronotype, wellbeing, and stimulant consumption are strongest in teenagers and young adults up to age 25 yrs. The most striking correlation exists between chronotype and smoking, which is significantly higher in late chronotypes of all ages (except for those in retirement). We show these correlations are most probably a consequence of social jetlag, i.e., the discrepancies between social and biological timing rather than a simple association to different chronotypes. Our results strongly suggest that work (and school) schedules should be adapted to chronotype whenever possible. Copyright {\textcopyright} Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Background: Disruption of sleep and circadian rhythmicity is a core feature of mood disorders and might be associated with increased susceptibility to such disorders. Previous studies in this area have used subjective reports of activity and sleep patterns, but the availability of accelerometer-based data from UK Biobank participants permits the derivation and analysis of new, objectively ascertained circadian rhythmicity parameters. We examined associations between objectively assessed circadian rhythmicity and mental health and wellbeing phenotypes, including lifetime history of mood disorder. Methods: UK residents aged 37–73 years were recruited into the UK Biobank general population cohort from 2006 to 2010. We used data from a subset of participants whose activity levels were recorded by wearing a wrist-worn accelerometer for 7 days. From these data, we derived a circadian relative amplitude variable, which is a measure of the extent to which circadian rhythmicity of rest–activity cycles is disrupted. In the same sample, we examined cross-sectional associations between low relative amplitude and mood disorder, wellbeing, and cognitive variables using a series of regression models. Our final model adjusted for age and season at the time that accelerometry started, sex, ethnic origin, Townsend deprivation score, smoking status, alcohol intake, educational attainment, overall mean acceleration recorded by accelerometry, body-mass index, and a binary measure of childhood trauma. Findings: We included 91 105 participants with accelerometery data collected between 2013 and 2015 in our analyses. A one-quintile reduction in relative amplitude was associated with increased risk of lifetime major depressive disorder (odds ratio [OR] 1{\textperiodcentered}06, 95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}04–1{\textperiodcentered}08) and lifetime bipolar disorder (1{\textperiodcentered}11, 1{\textperiodcentered}03–1{\textperiodcentered}20), as well as with greater mood instability (1{\textperiodcentered}02, 1{\textperiodcentered}01–1{\textperiodcentered}04), higher neuroticism scores (incident rate ratio 1{\textperiodcentered}01, 1{\textperiodcentered}01–1{\textperiodcentered}02), more subjective loneliness (OR 1{\textperiodcentered}09, 1{\textperiodcentered}07–1{\textperiodcentered}11), lower happiness (0{\textperiodcentered}91, 0{\textperiodcentered}90–0{\textperiodcentered}93), lower health satisfaction (0{\textperiodcentered}90, 0{\textperiodcentered}89–0{\textperiodcentered}91), and slower reaction times (linear regression coefficient 1{\textperiodcentered}75, 1{\textperiodcentered}05–2{\textperiodcentered}45). These associations were independent of demographic, lifestyle, education, and overall activity confounders. Interpretation: Circadian disruption is reliably associated with various adverse mental health and wellbeing outcomes, including major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. Lower relative amplitude might be linked to increased susceptibility to mood disorders. Funding: Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine.},

- Circadian disrutions associated with self-rated happiness, health satisfaction, and increased subjective loneliness -{\textgreater} imparied subjective wellbeing. 
- Objectively measured circadian disruption is associated with slower reaction times independent of demographic, lifestyle, activity, BMI, and childhood trauma covariates.

Primary 'IV': Cicardian relative amplitude
i.e. The relative difference between the most active continuous 10-h period (M10) and the least active continuous 5-h period (L5) in an average 24 h (midnight to midnight), and is a common non-parametric measure of the amplitude of rest–activity rhythms [(M10 - L5)/(M10+L5)].

Relative amplitude ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values reflecting clearer distinction between activity levels during the most and least active periods of the day. Lower values result from reduced daytime activity, increased night-time activity, or both.

Modelling: 

Associations between the relative amplitude predictor and each of the mental health, wellbeing, and cognitive dependent variables (lifetime major depressive disorder, lifetime bipolar disorder, mood instability, neuroticism, self-rated happiness, health satisfaction, loneliness, and reaction time) were examined in three separate regression models, each adjusting for more potential confounders than the previous model.

Associations between relative amplitude quintile and binary measures of lifetime major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, mood instability, and loneliness were examined with logistic regression, and ordinal logistic regression was used for the self-rated happiness and health satisfaction variables: odds ratios (OR) are reported. Linear regression was used to analyse reaction time and linear regression coefficients are reported. Negative binomial regression was used for models examining neuroticism, because this count-based variable had a skewed distribution, and incidence rate ratios (IRR) are reported. Robust standard errors were used.},

abstract = {People commonly increase sleep duration on the weekend to recover from sleep loss incurred during the workweek. Whether ad libitum weekend recovery sleep prevents metabolic dysregulation caused by recurrent insufficient sleep is unknown. Here, we assessed sleep, circadian timing, energy intake, weight gain, and insulin sensitivity during sustained insufficient sleep (9 nights) and during recurrent insufficient sleep following ad libitum weekend recovery sleep. Healthy, young adults were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (1) control (CON; 9-h sleep opportunities, n = 8), (2) sleep restriction without weekend recovery sleep (SR; 5-h sleep opportunities, n = 14), and (3) sleep restriction with weekend recovery sleep (WR; insufficient sleep for 5-day workweek, then 2 days of weekend recovery, then 2 nights of insufficient sleep, n = 14). For SR and WR groups, insufficient sleep increased after-dinner energy intake and body weight versus baseline. During ad libitum weekend recovery sleep, participants cumulatively slept ∼1.1 h more than baseline, and after-dinner energy intake decreased versus insufficient sleep. However, during recurrent insufficient sleep following the weekend, the circadian phase was delayed, and after-dinner energy intake and body weight increased versus baseline. In SR, whole-body insulin sensitivity decreased ∼13{\%} during insufficient sleep versus baseline, and in WR, whole-body, hepatic, and muscle insulin sensitivity decreased ∼9{\%}–27{\%} during recurrent insufficient sleep versus baseline. Furthermore, during the weekend, total sleep duration was lower in women versus men, and energy intake decreased to baseline levels in women but not in men. Our findings suggest that weekend recovery sleep is not an effective strategy to prevent metabolic dysregulation associated with recurrent insufficient sleep.},

abstract = {Using data from Wave 12 of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, we examine the impact of working hours on the cognitive ability of people living in Australia aged 40 years and older. Three measures of cognitive ability are employed: the Backward Digit Span; the Symbol Digits Modalities; and a 25-item version of the National Adult Reading Test. In order to capture the potential non-linear dependence of cognitive ability on working hours, the model for cognitive ability includes working hours and its square. We deal with the potential endogeneity of the decision of how many hours to work by using the instrumental variable estimation technique. Our findings show that there is a non-linearity in the effect of working hours on cognitive functioning. For working hours up to around 25 hours a week, an increase in working hours has a positive impact on cognitive functioning. However, when working hours exceed 25 hours per week, an increase in working hours has a negative impact on cognition. Interestingly, there is no statistical difference in the effects of working hours on cognitive functioning between men and women.},

abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to assess performance and cognitive states during cognitive work in the presence of physical work and in natural settings. Background: Authors of previous studies have examined the interaction between cognitive and physical work, finding performance decrements in working memory. Neuroimaging has revealed increases and decreases in prefrontal oxygenated hemoglobin during the interaction of cognitive and physical work. The effect of environment on cognitive-physical dual tasking has not been previously considered. Method: Thirteen participants were monitored with wireless functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) as they performed an auditory 1-back task while sitting, walking indoors, and walking outdoors. Results: Relative to sitting and walking indoors, auditory working memory performance declined when participants were walking outdoors. Sitting during the auditory 1-back task increased oxygenated hemoglobin and decreased deoxygenated hemoglobin in bilateral prefrontal cortex. Walking reduced the total hemoglobin available to bilateral prefrontal cortex. An increase in environmental complexity reduced oxygenated hemoglobin and increased deoxygenated hemoglobin in bilateral prefrontal cortex. Conclusion: Wireless fNIRS is capable of monitoring cognitive states in naturalistic environments. Selective attention and physical work compete with executive processing. During executive processing loading of selective attention and physical work results in deactivation of bilateral prefrontal cortex and degraded working memory performance, indicating that physical work and concomitant selective attention may supersede executive processing in the distribution of mental resources. Application: This research informs decision-making procedures in work where working memory, physical activity, and attention interact. Where working memory is paramount, precautions should be taken to eliminate competition from physical work and selective attention.},

abstract = {Human performance exhibits strong multi-tasking limitations in simple response time tasks. In the psychological refractory period (PRP) paradigm, where two tasks have to be performed in brief succession, central processing of the second task is delayed when the two tasks are performed at short time intervals. Here, we aimed to probe the cortical network underlying this postponement of central processing by simultaneously recording electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data while 12 subjects performed two simple number-comparison tasks. Behavioral data showed a significant slowing of response times to the second target stimulus at short stimulus-onset asynchronies, together with significant correlations between response times to the first and second target stimulus, i.e., the hallmarks of the PRP effect. The analysis of EEG data showed a significant delay of the post-perceptual P3 component evoked by the second target, which was of similar magnitude as the effect on response times. fMRI data revealed an involvement of parietal and prefrontal regions in dual-task processing. The combined analysis of fMRI and EEG data-based on the trial-by-trial variability of the P3-revealed that BOLD signals in two bilateral regions in the inferior parietal lobe and precentral gyrus significantly covaried with P3 related activity. Our results show that combining neuroimaging methods of high spatial and temporal resolutions can help to identify cortical regions underlying the central bottleneck of information processing, and strengthen the conclusion that fronto-parietal cortical regions participate in a distributed "global neuronal workspace" system that underlies the generation of the P3 component and may be one of the key cerebral underpinnings of the PRP bottleneck. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Facial expressions represent one of the most salient cues in our environment. They communicate the affective state and intent of an individual and, if interpreted correctly, adaptively influence the behavior of others in return. Processing of such affective stimuli is known to require reciprocal signaling between central viscerosensory brain regions and peripheral-autonomic body systems, culminating in accurate emotion discrimination. Despite emerging links between sleep and affective regulation, the impact of sleep loss on the discrimination of complex social emotions within and between the CNS and PNS remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate in humans that sleep deprivation impairs both viscerosensory brain (anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex, amygdala) and autonomic-cardiac discrimination of threatening from affiliative facial cues. Moreover, sleep deprivation significantly degrades the normally reciprocal associations between these central and peripheral emotion-signaling systems, most prominent at the level of cardiac-amygdala coupling. In addition, REM sleep physiology across the sleep-rested night significantly predicts the next-day success of emotional discrimination within this viscerosensory network across individuals, suggesting a role for REM sleep in affective brain recalibration. Together, these findings establish that sleep deprivation compromises the faithful signaling of, and the "embodied" reciprocity between, viscerosensory brain and peripheral autonomic body processing of complex social signals. Such impairments hold ecological relevance in professional contexts in which the need for accurate interpretation of social cues is paramount yet insufficient sleep is pervasive.},

abstract = {Objective: To determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) and near-crashes as reported by emergency medicine (EM) residents following various ED shifts. Methods: A survey was sent to all allopathic EM-2-EM-4 residents in May 1996 asking whether they had ever been involved in an MVC or near-crash while driving home after an ED shift. The residents' night shift schedules, self-reported tolerance of night work, ability to overcome drowsiness, sleep flexibility, and morningness/eveningness tendencies also were collected: Results: Seventy- eight programs participated and 62{\%} of 1,554 eligible residents returned usable surveys. Seventy-six (8{\%}, 95{\%} CI = 6{\%} to 10{\%}) residents reported having 96 crashes and 553 (58{\%}, 95{\%} CI = 55{\%} to 61{\%}) residents reported being involved in 1,446 near-crashes. Nearly three fourths of the MVCs and 80{\%} of the near-crashes followed the night shift. Stepwise logistic regression of all variables demonstrated a cumulative association (R = 0.19, p = 0.0004) that accounted for 4{\%} of the observed variability in MVCs and near-crashes. Univariate analysis showed that MVCs and near-crashes were inversely related to residents' shiftwork tolerance (p = 0.019) and positively related to the number of night shifts worked per month (p = 0.035). Conclusions: Residents reported being involved in a higher number of MVCs and near-crashes while driving home after a night shift compared with other shifts. Driving home after a night shift appears to be a significant occupational risk for EM residents.},

abstract = {Object: In humans, even a single night of partial sleep deprivation (PSD) can have a negative impact on cognition and affective processing, suggesting that sleep pressure represents a basic physiological constraint of brain function. Among the spontaneously fluctuating resting state networks, the default mode network (DMN) and its anticorrelated network (ACN) hold key functions in segregating internally and externally directed awareness. Task fMRI after sleep deprivation has revealed altered activation patterns in both networks. We hypothesized that effects of PSD in these intrinsically coupled networks can be detected by resting state fMRI. Methods: We obtained 6-minute echoplanar imaging time series (1.5 Tesla) during eyes-closed, wakeful-resting experiments from 16 healthy volunteers after normal sleep and after PSD. We used independent component and cross-correlation analysis to study functional connectivity (fc), focusing on the DMN and ACN. Results: After PSD, focal reductions of auto-correlation strength were detected in the posterior and anterior midline node of the DMN and in the lateral parietal and insular nodes of the ACN. Cross-correlation analysis confirmed reduced cortico-cortical connectivity within and between the DMN and ACN. Conclusions: Increased sleep pressure is reflected in reduced fc of main DMN and ACN nodes during rest. Results have implications for understanding perceptual and cognitive changes after sleep deprivation and are relevant to clinical studies on conditions in which increased sleep propensity is present. {\textcopyright} 2010 ESMRMB.},

abstract = {Background: Emotional information is frequently processed below the level of consciousness, where subcortical regions of the brain are thought to play an important role. In the absence of conscious visual experience, patients with visual cortex damage discriminate the valence of emotional expression. Even in healthy individuals, a subliminal mechanism can be utilized to compensate for a functional decline in visual cognition of various causes such as strong sleepiness. In this study, sleep deprivation was simulated in healthy individuals to investigate functional alterations in the subliminal processing of emotional information caused by reduced conscious visual cognition and attention due to an increase in subjective sleepiness. Fourteen healthy adult men participated in a within-subject crossover study consisting of a 5-day session of sleep debt (SD, 4-h sleep) and a 5-day session of sleep control (SC, 8-h sleep). On the last day of each session, participants performed an emotional face-viewing task that included backward masking of nonconscious presentations during magnetic resonance scanning. Results: Finally, data from eleven participants who were unaware of nonconscious face presentations were analyzed. In fear contrasts, subjective sleepiness was significantly positively correlated with activity in the amygdala, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and insular cortex, and was significantly negatively correlated with the secondary and tertiary visual areas and the fusiform face area. In fear-neutral contrasts, subjective sleepiness was significantly positively correlated with activity of the bilateral amygdala. Further, changes in subjective sleepiness (the difference between the SC and SD sessions) were correlated with both changes in amygdala activity and functional connectivity between the amygdala and superior colliculus in response to subliminal fearful faces.},

On a macroscopic level, sleep deprivation mainly affects executive functions, especially in novel tasks. Macroscopic and mesoscopic effects of sleep deprivation on brain activity include reduced cortical responsiveness to incoming stimuli, reflecting reduced attention. On a microscopic level, sleep deprivation is associated with increased levels of adenosine, a neuromodulator that has a general inhibitory effect on neural activity. The inhibition of cholinergic nuclei appears particularly relevant, as the associated decrease in cortical acetylcholine seems to cause effects of sleep deprivation on macroscopic brain activity. In general, however, the relationships between the neural effects of sleep deprivation across observation scales are poorly understood and uncovering these relationships should be a primary target in future research. {\textcopyright} 2007 Birkh{\"{a}}user Verlag.},

abstract = {Significant inter-individual differences in vigilance decline following sleep deprivation exist. We characterized functional connectivity in 68 healthy young adult participants in rested wakefulness and following a night of total sleep deprivation. After whole brain signal regression, functionally connected cortical networks during the well-rested state exhibited reduced correlation following sleep deprivation, suggesting that highly integrated brain regions become less integrated during sleep deprivation. In contrast, anti-correlations in the well-rested state became less so following sleep deprivation, suggesting that highly segregated networks become less segregated during sleep deprivation. Subjects more resilient to vigilance decline following sleep deprivation showed stronger anti-correlations among several networks. The weaker anti-correlations overlapped with connectivity alterations following sleep deprivation. Resilient individuals thus evidence clearer separation of highly segregated cortical networks in the well-rested state. In contrast to corticocortical connectivity, subcortical-cortical connectivity was comparable across resilient and vulnerable groups despite prominent state-related changes in both groups. Because sleep deprivation results in a significant elevation of whole brain signal amplitude, the aforesaid signal changes and group contrasts may be masked in analyses omitting their regression, suggesting possible value in regressing whole brain signal in certain experimental contexts.},

abstract = {Study Objectives: To determine whether occupational and neurophysiological decrements within shift work disorder (SWD) are differentially related to its two diagnostic symptoms, insomnia and excessive sleepiness. Methods: Thirty-four permanent night workers participated in an overnight lab protocol including a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) and an event-related brain potential (ERP) task testing auditory target detection (P3a and P3b). At 16:00, each subject completed an Endicott Work Productivity Scale (EWPS), two Insomnia Severity Indices (ISI-Day, ISI-Night), and an Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). Subjects were grouped by ISI and ESS scores into clinical phenotypes. This study compared EWPS and ERP results between alert insomniacs ("AI," reporting insomnia without sleepiness), sleepy insomniacs ("SI," reporting both insomnia and sleepiness), and controls. Results: The AI group was most impaired on the EWPS, significantly more impaired than controls (25.8 ± 14.8 vs. 12.3 ± 9.4, p {\textless} 0.05). SI were not statistically different from controls (19.5 ± 8.7 vs. 12.3 ± 9.4, p {\textgreater} 0.05). Compared to controls, AI showed significantly attenuated P3a response (Fcz, Czp, Cpz, mean difference [MD] 1.62-1.77, p {\textless} 0.05) and target-detection P3b response (Fcz, Czp, Cpz, MD 1.28-1.64, p {\textless} 0.05). P3b in SI was not different from controls (p {\textgreater} 0.10), and P3a was only different at one electrode site (Cpz, MD 1.43, p {\textless} 0.01). Neither the MSLT nor the ESS correlated with EWPS scores or ERP (P3a/P3b) amplitudes (p {\textgreater} 0.10). However, the mean of the ISI measurements correlated with the EWPS (r = 0.409, p {\textless} 0.01) and the attention-to-novelty P3a (r = -0.410, p {\textless} 0.01). Conclusions: Among shift work disorder patients, insomnia is linked to functional and cognitive impairments. Insomniacs with normal sleepiness showed more severe impairments than insomniacs who also reported excessive sleepiness.},

abstract = {The current paper expands on traditional views of the work-nonwork interface to incorporate the critical component of sleep. We integrate past theoretical and empirical work from the sleep and organizational science literatures to inform a novel framework that will facilitate research evaluating associations among work, nonwork, and sleep, the three major areas of life. We propose that attitudes, behaviors, and states emerging in work and nonwork domains cannot be fully understood without taking into account upstream and downstream sleep quantity and quality effects. Rather, periods of sleep bookend engagement in work and nonwork roles. Thus, we propose the work, nonwork, and sleep (WNS) conceptual framework and, in doing so, identify specific, underlying resource mechanisms (i.e., human energy and time) operating both intra-individually and inter-individually. We also discuss contextual factors that act as predictors and moderators of these relationships. We suggest that a unifying framework explaining connections and underlying processes among work, nonwork, and sleep is necessary for applied psychology and management disciplines to significantly contribute to future research, intervention development and dissemination, and ultimately policy change. We provide a number of avenues for future investigation, including relevant special populations and methodological approaches. Although a plethora of work-nonwork theoretical frameworks exist, none have incorporated the third major area of life: sleep. We call for the expansion and acknowledgement of sleep, an important source of variance in everyday attitudes, behaviors, and states, and ultimately in long-term organizational, family, and individual health and well-being.},

abstract = {Objective Insufficient time for recovery between workdays may cause fatigue and disturbed sleep. This study evaluated the impact of an intervention that reduced weekly working hours by 25{\%} on sleep, sleepiness and perceived stress for employees within the public sector. Method Participating workplaces (N=33) were randomized into intervention and control groups. Participants (N=580, 76{\%} women) worked full-time at baseline. The intervention group (N=354) reduced worktime to 75{\%} with preserved salary during 18 months. Data were collected at baseline and after 9 and 18 months follow-up. Sleep quality, sleep duration, sleepiness, perceived stress, and worries and stress at bedtime were measured with diary during one week per data collection. Result A multilevel mixed model showed that compared with the control group, at the 18-month follow-up, the intervention group had improved sleep quality and sleep duration (+23 minutes) and displayed reduced levels of sleepiness, perceived stress, and worries and stress at bedtime on workdays (P{\textless}0.002). The same effects were shown for days off (P{\textless}0.006), except for sleep length. Effect sizes were small (Cohen's f2{\textless}0.08). Adding gender, age, having children living at home, and baseline values of sleep quality and worries and stress at bedtime as additional between-group factors did not influence the results. Conclusion A 25{\%} reduction of weekly work hours with retained salary resulted in beneficial effects on sleep, sleepiness and perceived stress both on workdays and days off. These effects were maintained over an 18-month period. This randomized intervention thus indicates that reduced worktime may improve recovery and perceived stress.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen increased interest in neuroergonomics, which investigates the brain activities of people engaged in diverse physical and cognitive activities at work and in everyday life. The present work extends upon prior assessments of the state of this art. However, here we narrow our focus specifically to studies that use electroencephalography (EEG) to measure brain activity, correlates, and effects during physical activity. The review uses systematically selected, openly published works derived from a guided search through peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings. Identified studies were then categorized by the type of physical activity and evaluated considering methodological and chronological aspects via statistical and content-based analyses. From the identified works (n = 110), a specific number (n = 38) focused on less mobile muscular activities, while an additional group (n = 22) featured both physical and cognitive tasks. The remainder (n = 50) investigated various physical exercises and sporting activities and thus were here identified as a miscellaneous grouping. Most of the physical activities were isometric exertions, moving parts of upper and lower limbs, or walking and cycling. These primary categories were sub-categorized based on movement patterns, the use of the event-related potentials (ERP) technique, the use of recording methods along with EEG and considering mental effects. Further information on subjects' gender, EEG recording devices, data processing, and artifact correction methods and citations was extracted. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the findings from various studies, statistical analyses were not performed. These were thus included in a descriptive fashion. Finally, contemporary research gaps were pointed out, and future research prospects to address those gaps were discussed.},

abstract = {Central to the development of clinical applications of functional connectomics for neurology and psychiatry is the discovery and validation of biomarkers. Resting state fMRI (R-fMRI) is emerging as a mainstream approach for imaging-based biomarker identification, detecting variations in the functional connectome that can be attributed to clinical variables (e.g., diagnostic status). Despite growing enthusiasm, many challenges remain. Here, we assess evidence of the readiness of R-fMRI based functional connectomics to lead to clinically meaningful biomarker identification through the lens of the criteria used to evaluate clinical tests (i.e., validity, reliability, sensitivity, specificity, and applicability). We focus on current R-fMRI-based prediction efforts, and survey R-fMRI used for neurosurgical planning. We identify gaps and needs for R-fMRI-based biomarker identification, highlighting the potential of emerging conceptual, analytical and cultural innovations (e.g., the Research Domain Criteria Project (RDoC), open science initiatives, and Big Data) to address them. Additionally, we note the need to expand future efforts beyond identification of biomarkers for disease status alone to include clinical variables related to risk, expected treatment response and prognosis. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Research demonstrates a negative impact of sleep disturbance on mood and affect; however, the biological mechanisms mediating these links are poorly understood. Amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli has emerged as one potential pathway. Here, we investigate the influence of self-reported sleep quality on associations between threat-related amygdala reactivity and measures of negative affect and perceived stress. METHODS: Analyses on data from 299 participants (125 men, 50.5{\%} white, mean [standard deviation] age = 19.6 [1.3] years) who completed the Duke Neurogenetics Study were conducted. Participants completed several self-report measures of negative affect and perceived stress. Threat-related (i.e., angry and fearful facial expressions) amygdala reactivity was assayed using blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Global sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. RESULTS: Amygdala reactivity to fearful facial expressions predicted greater depressive symptoms and higher perceived stress in poor ($\beta$ values = 0.18-1.86, p values {\textless} .05) but not good sleepers ($\beta$ values = -0.13 to -0.01, p values {\textgreater} .05). In sex-specific analyses, men reporting poorer global sleep quality showed a significant association between amygdala reactivity and levels of depression and perceived stress ($\beta$ values = 0.29-0.44, p values {\textless} .05). In contrast, no significant associations were observed in men reporting good global sleep quality or in women, irrespective of sleep quality. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel evidence that self-reported sleep quality moderates the relationships between amygdala reactivity, negative affect, and perceived stress, particularly among men.

Sleep deficiencies associated with insufficient sleep schedules, insomnia with short-sleep duration, sleep apnea, narcolepsy, circadian misalignment, shift work, night eating syndrome, and sleep-related eating disorder may all contribute to metabolic dysregulation. Sleep deficiencies and circadian disruption associated with metabolic dysregulation may contribute to weight gain, obesity, and type 2 diabetes potentially by altering timing and amount of food intake, disrupting energy balance, inflammation, impairing glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity. Given the rapidly increasing prevalence of metabolic diseases, it is important to recognize the role of sleep and circadian disruption in the development, progression, and morbidity of metabolic disease.

abstract = {Approximately 10{\%} of the employed population in the United States works in multiple jobs. They are more likely to work long hours and in nonstandard work schedules, factors known to impact sleep duration and quality, and increase the risk of injury. In this study we used multivariate regression models to compare the duration of sleep in a 24-hour period between workers working in multiple jobs (MJHs) with single job holders (SJHs) controlling for other work schedule and demographic factors. We used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics US American Time Use Survey (ATUS) pooled over a 9-year period (2003–2011). We found that MJHs had significantly reduced sleep duration compared with SJHs due to a number of independent factors, such as working longer hours and more often late at night. Male MJHs, working in their primary job or more than one job on the diary day, also had significantly shorter sleep durations (up to 40 minutes less on a weekend day) than male SJHs, even after controlling for all other factors. Therefore, duration of work hours, time of day working and duration of travel for work may not be the only factors to consider when understanding if male MJHs are able to fit in enough recuperative rest from their busy schedule. Work at night had the greatest impact on sleep duration for females, reducing sleep time by almost an hour compared with females who did not work at night. We also hypothesize that the high frequency or fragmentation of non-leisure activities (e.g. work and travel for work) throughout the day and between jobs may have an additional impact on the duration and quality of sleep for MJHs.},

abstract = {One workweek of mild sleep restriction adversely impacts sleepiness, performance, and proinflammatory cytokines. Many individuals try to overcome these adverse effects by extending their sleep on weekends. To assess whether extended recovery sleep reverses the effects of mild sleep restriction on sleepiness/alertness, inflammation, and stress hormones, 30 healthy young men and women (mean age ± SD, 24.7 ± 3.5 yr; mean body mass index ± SD, 23.6 ± 2.4 kg/m2) participated in a sleep laboratory experiment of 13 nights [4 baseline nights (8 h/night), followed by 6 sleep restriction nights (6 h/night) and 3 recovery nights (10 h/night)]. Twenty-four-hour profiles of circulating IL-6 and cortisol, objective and subjective daytime sleepiness (Multiple Sleep Latency Test and Stanford Sleepiness Scale), and performance (Psychomotor Vigilance Task) were assessed on days 4 (baseline), 10 (after 1 wk of sleep restriction), and 13 (after 2 nights of recovery sleep). Serial 24-h IL-6 plasma levels increased significantly during sleep restriction and returned to baseline after recovery sleep. Serial 24-h cortisol levels during restriction did not change compared with baseline, but after recovery they were significantly lower. Subjective and objective sleepiness increased significantly after restriction and returned to baseline after recovery. In contrast, performance deteriorated significantly after restriction and did not improve after recovery. Extended recovery sleep over the weekend reverses the impact of one work week of mild sleep restriction on daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and IL-6 levels, reduces cortisol levels, but does not correct performance deficits. The long-term effects of a repeated sleep restriction/sleep recovery weekly cycle in humans remain unknown. {\textcopyright} 2013 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract = {Sleep deprivation is known to impair a range of functions, including immune regulation and metabolic control, as well as neurocognitive processes, such as learning and memory [1]. But evidence for the role of sleep in regulating our emotional brain-state is surprisingly scarce, and while the dysregulation of affective stability following sleep loss has received subjective documentation [2,3], any neural examination remains absent. Clinical evidence suggests that sleep and emotion interact; nearly all psychiatric and neurological disorders expressing sleep disruption display corresponding symptoms of affective imbalance [4]. Independent of sleep, knowledge of the basic neural and cognitive mechanisms regulating emotion is remarkably advanced. The amygdala has a well-documented role in the processing of emotionally salient information, particularly aversive stimuli [5,6]. The extent of amygdala engagement can also be influenced by a variety of connected systems, particularly the medial-prefrontal cortex (MPFC); the MPFC is proposed to exert an inhibitory, top-down control of amygdala function, resulting in contextually appropriate emotional responses [5,6]. We have focused on this network and using functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI) have obtained evidence, reported here, that a lack of sleep inappropriately modulates the human emotional brain response to negative aversive stimuli (see Supplemental data available on-line with this issue). {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Objectives To evaluate cross-sectional and prospective associations between short and long sleep duration and depressive symptoms in older adults (aged {\textgreater}65 years). Methods The data from a subsample of the racially/ethnically diverse Northern Manhattan Study were analyzed. Depressive symptoms were assessed twice with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), approximately 5 years apart. The presence of depressive symptoms was defined as a CES-D score ≥16 or use of antidepressants. Self-reports of short ({\textless}6 h), intermediate (6–8 h) and long (≥9 h) sleep were assessed prior to the initial CES-D. Logistic regression was used to evaluate the cross-sectional associations between short and long sleep durations with depressive symptoms, using intermediate sleep as the reference. The prospective association between sleep duration and depression in a sample of participants without depressive symptoms at first CES-D was also analyzed. All models were adjusted for demographic, behavioral, and vascular risk factors. Results The initial sample consisted of 1110 participants: 62{\%} women, 69{\%} Hispanic, 17{\%} black, 14{\%} white. Short sleep was reported by 25{\%}, intermediate sleep by 65{\%}, and long sleep by 9{\%}. Depressive symptoms were described in 25{\%} of the initial sample. Short sleep, but not long sleep, was associated with depressive symptoms at baseline (adjusted OR 1.8, 95{\%} CI 1.3–2.6), and at follow-up (adjusted OR 1.9, 95{\%} CI 1.1–3.5; median follow-up = 5.1 years).

abstract = {Objective: Exercise and sleep are two important health promoting behaviors, but large parts of the population do not exercise or are chronically sleep deprived. We investigated to what degree exercise and sleep compete with each other and with other waking activities for time. Methods: Analyses are based on 2003-2016 American Time Use Survey data of a representative sample of N = 47,862 working Americans aged 18-65 years interviewed on weekdays. Models were adjusted for various sociodemographic variables and time spent working on the interview day. Results: Long work hours and several sociodemographic variables were associated both with short sleep and low exercise rates. Respondents who exercised slept on average 15.5 min less (95{\%} CI: -18.4 min; -12.7 min, P {\textless}.0001) than those who did not exercise. Sleep duration decreased with exercise duration in a dose-dependent manner. The strongest association between exercise and sleep duration was observed for exercise between 6 AM and 8 AM (ie, before work) and between 9 PM and 11 PM (ie, before bed). However, unless exercise was performed before work in the morning, exercise durations of up to 1 h were not associated with relevantly curtailed sleep. Conclusions: These results confirm that exercise and sleep compete with each other for time. However, exercise regimens that follow current guidelines are unlikely to curtail sleep substantially, especially since exercise has been shown to positively affect sleep structure and quality. Public health efforts should nevertheless emphasize the importance of both exercise and sleep, and of not sacrificing one activity for the other.},

abstract = {Objective: Recent neuroimaging studies aimed at investigating effects of psychological stress on the neural activity have used a range of experimental paradigms to elicit an acute stress response. The goal of this review is to, first, summarize results from these studies from a perspective of task design and, second, assess the appropriateness of the different stress tasks used. Method: We completed a PubMed search on recent articles that have examined the effects of psychological stress on neural processes in a neuroimaging environment. Selected articles were arranged according to the stress task used in the following categories: script-driven stress stimuli, Stroop colour-word interference task, speech in front of an audience, serial subtraction, and Montreal Imaging Stress Task (MIST). Results: Only studies using serial subtraction or the MIST were able to induce a significant cortisol stress response in their participants. Most consistent findings include decreased activity in orbitofrontal regions in response to stress. Additional findings of note are increases in activity in the frontal lobes, particularly the anterior cingulate cortex, as well as deactivation of the limbic system, particularly the hippocampus. Conclusion: Research to date is beginning to outline the involvement of prefrontal and limbic regions in perception and modulation of psychological stress. However, additional research is needed in designing a neuroimaging stress task that will yield a significant cortisol stress response consistently, across populations and laboratories.},

The ability to identify meaningful biomarkers is limited by measurement reliability; unreliable measures are unsuitable for predicting clinical outcomes. Measuring brain activity using task-fMRI is a major focus of biomarker development; however, the reliability of task-fMRI has not been systematically evaluated. We present converging evidence demonstrating poor reliability of task-fMRI measures. First, a meta-analysis of 90 experiments (N=1,008) revealed poor overall reliability (mean ICC=.397). Second, the test-retest reliabilities of activity in a priori regions of interest across 11 common fMRI tasks collected in the context of the Human Connectome Project (N=45) and the Dunedin Study (N=20) were poor (ICCs=.067-.485). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that common task-fMRI measures are not currently suitable for brain biomarker discovery or individual differences research. We review how this state of affairs came to be and highlight avenues for improving task-fMRI reliability.},

An online mental health questionnaire was designed for UK Biobank participants to expand its potential. AIMS Describe the development, implementation and results of this questionnaire. METHOD An expert working group designed the questionnaire, using established measures where possible, and consulting a patient group. Operational criteria were agreed for defining likely disorder and risk states, including lifetime depression, mania/hypomania, generalised anxiety disorder, unusual experiences and self-harm, and current post-traumatic stress and hazardous/harmful alcohol use. RESULTS A total of 157 366 completed online questionnaires were available by August 2017. Participants were aged 45-82 (53{\%} were ≥65 years) and 57{\%} women. Comparison of self-reported diagnosed mental disorder with a contemporary study shows a similar prevalence, despite respondents being of higher average socioeconomic status. Lifetime depression was a common finding, with 24{\%} (37 434) of participants meeting criteria and current hazardous/harmful alcohol use criteria were met by 21{\%} (32 602), whereas other criteria were met by less than 8{\%} of the participants. There was extensive comorbidity among the syndromes. Mental disorders were associated with a high neuroticism score, adverse life events and long-term illness; addiction and bipolar affective disorder in particular were associated with measures of deprivation. CONCLUSIONS The UK Biobank questionnaire represents a very large mental health survey in itself, and the results presented here show high face validity, although caution is needed because of selection bias. Built into UK Biobank, these data intersect with other health data to offer unparalleled potential for crosscutting biomedical research involving mental health.},

abstract = {Background Detailed assessments of mortality by occupation are scarce. We aimed to assess mortality by occupation in the UK, differences in rates between England and Wales and Scotland, and changes over time in Scotland. Methods We analysed adults of working age (20–59 years) using linked census and death records. Main occupation was coded into more than 60 groups in the 2001 census, with mortality follow-up until Dec 31, 2011. Comparable occupation data were available for Scotland in 1991, allowing assessment of trends over time. We calculated age-standardised all-cause mortality rates (per 100 000 person-years), stratified by sex. We used Monte Carlo simulation to derive p values and 95{\%} CIs for the difference in mortality over time and between England and Wales and Scotland. Findings During 4{\textperiodcentered}51 million person-years of follow-up, mortality rates by occupation differed by more than three times between the lowest and highest observed rates in both men and women. Among men in England and Wales, health professionals had the lowest mortality (225 deaths per 100 000 person-years [95{\%} CI 145–304]), with low rates also shown in managers and teachers. The highest mortality rates were in elementary construction (701 deaths per 100 000 person-years [95{\%} CI 593–809]), and housekeeping and factory workers. Among women, teachers and business professionals had low mortality, and factory workers and garment trade workers had high rates. Mortality rates have generally fallen, but have stagnated or even increased among women in some occupations, such as cleaners (337 deaths per 100 000 person years [95{\%} CI 292–382] in 1991, rising to 426 deaths per 100 000 person years in 2001 [371–481]). Findings from simulation models suggested that if mortality rates by occupation in England and Wales applied to Scotland, 631 fewer men (95{\%} CI 285–979; a 9{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} decrease) and 273 fewer women (26–513; 6{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} decrease) of working age would die in Scotland every year. Excess deaths in Scotland were concentrated among lower skilled occupations (eg, female cleaners). Interpretation Mortality rates differ greatly by occupation. The excess mortality in Scotland is concentrated among low-skilled workers and, although mortality has improved in men and women in most occupational groups, some groups have experienced increased rates. Future research investigating the specific causes of death at the detailed occupational level will be valuable, particularly with a view to understanding the health implications of precarious employment and the need to improve working conditions in very specific occupational groups.

abstract = {Evolution is the process in which traits such as physiological stress response systems (SRSs) are shaped by natural selection. A full understanding of any trait requires knowing its evolutionary history, how it has given a selective advantage, and the trade-offs and costs involved. Stress-related mechanisms emerged early in the history of life. Like all traits, they have costs as well as benefits. Because the stress response is so often associated with negative events, its utility has often been neglected. This chapter reviews the phylogeny and functional significance of the SRS, with a special focus on how selection has shaped the mechanisms that process environmental information to regulate the stress response, and how the stress response influences other traits such as risk-taking and sexual behavior.},

abstract = {In a visually stimulating environment with competing stimuli, we continually choose where to allocate attention, and what to ignore. Wake and circadian-dependent modulation of attentional control and resolution of conflict is poorly understood. Twenty-two participants (17males; 25.6 ± 5.6 years) completed ocular motor tasks throughout 40 hours of sleep deprivation under constant routine conditions. A prosaccade task required a reflexive saccade toward a stimulus (no conflict), while an antisaccade task required inhibiting a reflexive saccade to the peripheral stimulus, and looking in the mirror opposite instead (conflict resolution). Antisaccade inhibitory errors showed circadian modulation, being highest in the morning, progressively decreasing until melatonin onset, before returning to the prior morning's peak throughout the biological night. This diurnal rhythm was blunted by sleep loss ({\textgreater}24 hours), with inhibitory control remaining impaired across the second biological day. For prosaccade, responses slowed down during the biological night. Taken together, we provide evidence for a circadian modulation of attentional bias: the morning being biased toward reflexive responding, and the evening toward higher inhibitory control. Our data show that sleep loss and circadian timing differentially impact attention, depending on whether a response conflict is present (antisaccade) or absent (prosaccade).},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE - Short sleep duration is associated with impaired glucose tolerance and an increased risk of diabetes. The effects of sleep restriction on insulin sensitivity have not been established. This study tests the hypothesis that decreasing nighttime sleep duration reduces insulin sensitivity and assesses the effects of a drug, modafinil, that increases alertness during wakefulness. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - This 12-day inpatient General Clinical Research Center study included 20 healthy men (age 20-35 years and BMI 20-30 kg/m2). Subjects spent 10 h/night in bed for ≥8 nights including three inpatient nights (sleep-replete condition), followed by 5 h/night in bed for 7 nights (sleep-restricted condition). Subjects received 300 mg/day modafinil or placebo during sleep restriction. Diet and activity were controlled. On the last 2 days of each condition, we assessed glucose metabolism by intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT) and euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp. Salivary cortisol, 24-h urinary catecholamines, and neurobehavioral performance were measured. RESULTS - IVGTT-derived insulin sensitivity was reduced by (means ± SD) 20 ± 24{\%} after sleep restriction (P = 0.001), without significant alterations in the insulin secretory response. Similarly, insulin sensitivity assessed by clamp was reduced by 11 ± 5.5{\%} (P {\textless} 0.04) after sleep restriction. Glucose tolerance and the disposition index were reduced by sleep restriction. These outcomes were not affected by modafinil treatment. Changes in insulin sensitivity did not correlate with changes in salivary cortisol (increase of 51 ± 8{\%} with sleep restriction, P {\textless} 0.02), urinary catecholamines, or slow wave sleep. CONCLUSIONS - Sleep restriction (5 h/night) for 1 week significantly reduces insulin sensitivity, raising concerns about effects of chronic insufficient sleep on disease processes associated with insulin resistance. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the American Diabetes Association.},

abstract = {Background: Shift work is associated with increased cardiometabolic disease risk, but whether this association is influenced by cardiometabolic risk factors driving selection into shift work is currently unclear. We addressed this question using Mendelian randomization (MR) in the UK Biobank (UKB). Methods: We created genetic risk scores (GRS) associating with nine cardiometabolic risk factors (including education, body mass index [BMI], smoking, and alcohol consumption), and tested associations of each GRS with self-reported current frequency of shift work and night shift work amongst employed UKB participants of European ancestry (n=190,573). We used summary-level MR sensitivity analyses and multivariable MR to probe robustness of the identified effects, and tested whether effects were mediated through sleep timing preference. Results: Genetically instrumented lower educational attainment and higher body mass index increased odds of reporting frequent shift work (odds ratio [OR] per 3.6 years [1-SD] decrease in educational attainment=2.40, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]=2.22-2.59, p=4.84 x 10-20; OR per 4.7kg/m2 [1-SD] increase in BMI=1.30, 95{\%}CI=1.14-1.47, p=5.85 x 10-05). Results were unchanged in sensitivity analyses allowing for different assumptions regarding horizontal pleiotropy, and the effects of education and BMI were independent in multivariable MR. No causal effects were evident for the remaining factors, nor for any exposures on selection out of shift work. Sleep timing preference did not mediate any identified effects. Conclusions: Educational attainment and BMI may influence selection into shift work, which may have implications for epidemiologic associations of shift work with cardiometabolic disease. {\#}{\#}{\#} Competing Interest Statement C.V., during the conduct of the study, was a scientific advisory board member of Circadian Light Therapy Inc., and served as a paid consultant to the US Department of Energy outside the submitted work. {\#}{\#}{\#} Funding Statement R01 DK105072 (Saxena, Dashti, Vetter), R21OH011052 (Schernhammer, Vetter), R01 DK107859 (Dashti, Saxena), R01DK102696 (Saxena), MGH Research Scholar Fund (Saxena), Diabetes UK 17/0005700 (Rutter), The University of Manchester (Research Infrastructure Fund).

abstract = {Objective: Environmental factors play a prominent role in multiple sclerosis (MS) etiology. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential association between shift work and MS risk, which has previously never been investigated. Methods: This report is based on 2 population-based, case-control studies, 1 with incident cases (1,343 cases, 2,900 controls) and 1 with prevalent cases (5,129 cases, 4,509 controls). Using logistic regression, the occurrence of MS among subjects who have been exposed to shift work at various ages was compared with that of those who have never been exposed by calculating the odds ratio (OR) with a 95{\%} confidence interval (CI). Results: In both studies, there was a significant association between working shift at a young age and occurrence of MS (OR, 1.6; 95{\%} CI, 1.2-2.1 in the incidence study and OR, 1.3; 95{\%} CI, 1.0-1.6 in the prevalence study). In the incident study, the OR of developing MS was 2.0 (95{\%} CI, 1.2-3.6) among those who had worked shifts for 3 years or longer before age 20 years, compared with those who had never worked shifts. The OR for the corresponding comparison in the prevalent study was 2.1 (95{\%} CI, 1.3-3.4). Interpretation: The observed association between shift work at a young age and occurrence of MS in 2 independent studies strengthens the notion of a true relationship. Consequences of shift work such as circadian disruption and sleep restriction are associated with disturbed melatonin secretion and enhanced proinflammatory responses and may thus be part of the mechanism behind the association.

abstract = {Sleep disorders have become a global issue, and discovering their causes and consequences are the focus of many research endeavors. An estimated 70 million Americans suffer from some form of sleep disorder. Certain sleep disorders have been shown to cause neurocognitive impairment such as decreased cognitive ability, slower response times and performance detriments. Recent research suggests that individuals with sleep abnormalities are also at greater risk of serious adverse health, economic consequences, and most importantly increased all-cause mortality. Several research studies support the associations among sleep, immune function and inflammation. Here, we review the current research linking sleep, immune function, and gastrointestinal diseases and discuss the interdependent relationship between sleep and these gastrointestinal disorders. Different physiologic processes including immune system and inflammatory cytokines help regulate the sleep. The inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1 (IL-1), and IL-6 have been shown to be a significant contributor of sleep disturbances. On the other hand, sleep disturbances such as sleep deprivation have been shown to up regulate these inflammatory cytokines. Alterations in these cytokine levels have been demonstrated in certain gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, gastro-esophageal reflux, liver disorders and colorectal cancer. In turn, abnormal sleep brought on by these diseases is shown to contribute to the severity of these same gastrointestinal diseases. Knowledge of these relationships will allow gastroenterologists a great opportunity to enhance the care of their patients. {\textcopyright} 2013 Baishideng Publishing Group Co., Limited.

Methods and results Circadian variations in vagally mediated heart rate variability (HRV) and the morning rise in cortisol were evaluated in 60 participants working in a government building either in a traditional (individual offices and old cubicles; n= 40) or a modern workspace (individualized cubicles with improved views and lighting; n= 20). Results revealed significant linear (B = 1.03; confidence interval: 1.05 to 1.01, P [ 0.05) and quadratic (B = 1.001; confidence interval: 1.00041.002, P [ 0.05) trends by office type interactions for indices of vagally mediated HRV. Individuals in the old office space had flatter slopes and thus less circadian variation including less HRV at night, and a larger rise in cortisol upon awakening compared with those in the new office space. Conclusion These results indicate that physical features of the work environment may affect two aspects of the physiological stress response: circadian variations in HRV and the morning rise in cortisol.

abstract = {The superficial amygdala (SFA) is important in human emotion/affective processing via its strong connection with other limbic and cerebral cortex for receptive and expressive emotion processing. Few studies have investigated the functional connectivity changes of the SFA under extreme conditions, such as prolonged sleep loss, although the SFA showed a distinct functional connectivity pattern throughout the brain. In this study, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was employed to investigate the changes of SFA-cortical functional connectivity after 36 hr of total sleep deprivation (TSD). Fourteen healthy male volunteers aged 25.9±2.3 years (range 18-28 years) enrolled in this within-subject crossover study. We found that the right SFA showed increased functional connectivity with the right medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and decreased functional connectivity with the right dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (dPCC) in the resting brain after TSD compared with that during rested wakefulness. For the left SFA, decreased connectivity with the right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and right dPCC was found. Further regression analysis indicated that the functional link between mPFC and SFA significantly correlated with the Profile of Mood State scores. Our results suggest that the amygdala cannot be treated as a single unit in human neuroimaging studies and that TSD may alter the functional connectivity pattern of the SFA, which in turn disrupts emotional regulation.},

It combines two disciplines: neuroscience, the study of brain structure and function; and ergonomics, the study of how to match technology with the capabilities and limitations of people so they can work effectively and safely.

Research in the area of neuroergonomics has blossomed in recent years with the emergence of non-invasive techniques for monitoring human brain function that can be used to study various aspects of human behavior in relation to technology and work, including mental workload, visual attention, working memory, motor control, human-automation interaction, and adaptive automation.

Thus, long and unusual working hours increase the risk of psychovegetative health impairments both directly and indirectly, moderated by the subjective work-life balance. In fact, the indirect effects of working time on PVIs via the work-life balance seem to be stronger than the direct effects. Results of a cross-validation study of four independent and representative samples from Germany and the European Union (N{\textgreater}50,000) indicate high structural stability of these results and thus an increased validity and range for generalization. copyright {\textcopyright} 2010 Informa UK Ltd.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine a regular rotating 12-h shift system (2D2N4Off) at an Australian Smelter. Sleep behavior, subjective fatigue and neurobehavioral performance were investigated over a 14-day period for 20 employees. Activity monitors, sleep/wake diaries, and 5-min psychomotor vigilance tasks were used. Sleep data showed differences between day and night shifts. While sleep prior to night1 was increased relative to day shifts, a reduced sleep length carried into the period leading to night2. Total wakefulness at the end of shift, and subjective fatigue were increased for night shifts, particularly night1. Decrements in performance data supported these findings. Both prior wakefulness and prior sleep are important in a 12-h shift system. Employees may "sleep in" after day shifts, rather than taking extra sleep prior to night work. Thus, sleep between day and night shifts is based on recovery rather than preparation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Lindquist2020,
abstract = {For most types of big data, from genome sequences to medical images, there is no single 'best' way to process the data. This issue is exemplified by the substantial differences in how individual laboratories preprocess and analyse data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, which generate information about brain activity. Indeed, a survey of fMRI studies found that nearly every study used a different analysis pipeline 1. Writing in Nature, Botvinik-Nezer et al. 2 provide further evidence of this variability, highlighting how analytical choices made by individual researchers can greatly influence the findings gleaned from an fMRI data set. The work is bound to spark lively discussion. Functional MRI experiments produce a series of images of the brain at work. These images go through several stages of processing and analysis to determine which brain regions show significant activity. However, the choice of pipeline can alter the outcome of an fMRI study. In 2012, for instance, 6,912 unique processing and analysis pipelines were applied to the same fMRI data set 3. Many of the pipelines indicated that the same general brain regions were active, but the locations at which neu-ral activity was deemed to be highest varied widely depending on the pipeline used. Botvinik-Nezer et al. explored this phenomenon further. The authors gave 70 independent research teams the same fMRI data set, generated from 108 people performing decision-related tasks. The teams were asked to use the data set to test nine hypo theses, each of which posited that activity in a specific brain region related to a particular feature of the tasks. This allowed Botvinik-Nezer et al. to evaluate the impact of analytical flexibility on fMRI results 'in the wild' (rather than performing the analyses themselves, as was done in the 2012 study). Notably, no two teams chose identical workflows to analyse the data, resulting in substantial variation in the results (Fig. 1). It is standard in neuroimaging to test types of hypothesis such as the nine put forward by Botvinik-Nezer et al. by generating a statistical map. The map comprises a compendium of statistical tests performed on different parts (voxels) of the image. The results of these tests are subjected to a process called thresholding to set the level, for each voxel, at which activity picked up by the experiment is deemed to indicate real neuronal activity rather than noise. The authors found considerable differences between each research team's results even when the underlying statistical maps they had used were highly correlated. The strongest factor in explaining the differences between each team's results was the spatial smoothness of the data being analysed. Spatial smoothing is a preprocessing step in which the activity of each voxel is averaged with that of its neighbours-a process designed to reduce noise. Higher estimated smoothness was associated with a greater likelihood of reaching a significant outcome for each hypothesis. The fact that each team's results were so pipeline-dependent is highly problematic, partic ularly because the exact configuration of analytical pipelines is often poorly described in research articles. Moreover, sensitivity analyses-which assess how different pipeline choices might affect an experi-ment's outcome-are rarely performed in neuroimaging. However, Botvinik-Nezer and colleagues offer several reasonable suggestions for addressing the concerns that their work will raise. The first is to share unthresholded activity maps, because this will allow image-based meta-analysis. The authors found that such an analysis, which aggregated information across teams, yielded consensus results, no doubt aided by the fact that the spatial patterns in the activity maps were highly correlated across groups.},

abstract = {Objectives: Sleep debt reportedly increases emotional instability, such as anxiety and confusion, in addition to sleepiness and psychomotor impairment. However, the neural basis of emotional instability due to sleep debt has yet to be elucidated. This study investigated changes in emotional responses that are elicited by the simulation of short-term sleep loss and the brain regions responsible for these changes. Subjects and Methods: Fourteen healthy adult men aged 24.1±3.3 years (range, 20-32 years) participated in a within-subject crossover study consisting of 5-day sessions of both sleep debt (4 h for time in bed) and sleep control (8 h for time in bed). On the last day of each session, participants underwent polysomnography and completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Profile of Mood States questionnaires. In addition, functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted while performing an emotional face viewing task. Results: Restricted sleep over the 5-day period increased the activity of the left amygdala in response to the facial expression of fear, whereas a happy facial expression did not change the activity. Restricted sleep also resulted in a significant decrease in the functional connectivity between the amygdala and the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC) in proportion to the degree of sleep debt (as indicated by the percentage of slow wave sleep and $\delta$ wave power). This decrease was significantly correlated with activation of the left amygdala and deterioration of subjective mood state. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that continuous and accumulating sleep debt that can be experienced in everyday life can downregulate the functional suppression of the amygdala by the vACC and consequently enhance the response of the amygdala to negative emotional stimuli. Such functional alteration in emotional control may, in part, be attributed to the neural basis of emotional instability during sleep debt. {\textcopyright} 2013 Motomura et al.},

abstract = {Background: Approximately 30{\%} of the U.S. population reports recurrent short sleep; however, perceived sleep need varies widely among individuals. Some “habitual short sleepers” routinely sleep 4–6 hr/night without self-reported adverse consequences. Identifying neural mechanisms underlying individual differences in perceived sleep-related dysfunction has important implications for understanding associations between sleep duration and health. Method: This study utilized data from 839 subjects of the Human Connectome Project to examine resting functional connectivity associations with self-reported short sleep duration, as well as differences between short sleepers with versus without reported dysfunction. Functional connectivity was analyzed using a parcellation covering the cortical, subcortical, and cerebellar gray matter at 5 mm resolution. Results: Self-reported sleep duration predicts one of the primary patterns of intersubject variance in resting functional connectivity. Compared to conventional sleepers, both short sleeper subtypes exhibited resting fMRI (R-fMRI) signatures consistent with diminished wakefulness, potentially indicating inaccurate perception of functionality among those denying dysfunction. Short sleepers denying dysfunction exhibited increased connectivity between sensory cortices and bilateral amygdala and hippocampus, suggesting that efficient sleep-related memory consolidation may partly explain individual differences in perceived daytime dysfunction. Conclusions: Overall, current findings indicate that R-fMRI investigations should include assessment of average sleep duration during the prior month. Furthermore, short sleeper subtype findings provide a candidate neural mechanism underlying differences in perceived daytime impairment associated with short sleep duration.},

@article{Dembe2005,
abstract = {Aims: To analyse the impact of overtime and extended working hours on the risk of occupational injuries and illnesses among a nationally representative sample of working adults from the United States. Methods: Responses from 10 793 Americans participating in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) were used to evaluate workers' job histories, work schedules, and occurrence of occupational injury and illness between 1987 and 2000. A total of 110 236 job records were analysed, encompassing 89 729 person-years of accumulated working time. Aggregated incidence rates in each of five exposure categories were calculated for each NLSY survey period. Multivariate analytical techniques were used to estimate the relative risk of long working hours per day, extended hours per week, long commute times, and overtime schedules on reporting a work related injury or illness, after adjusting for age, gender, occupation, industry, and region. Results: After adjusting for those factors, working in jobs with overtime schedules was associated with a 61{\%} higher injury hazard rate compared to jobs without overtime. Working at least 12 hours per day was associated with a 37{\%} increased hazard rate and working at least 60 hours per week was associated with a 23{\%} increased hazard rate. A strong dose-response effect was observed, with the injury rate (per 100 accumulated worker-years in a particular schedule) increasing in correspondence to the number of hours per day (or per week) in the workers' customary schedule. Conclusions: Results suggest that job schedules with long working hours are not more risky merely because they are concentrated in inherently hazardous industries or occupations, or because people working long hours spend more total time "at risk" for a work injury. Strategies to prevent work injuries should consider changes in scheduling practices, job redesign, and health protection programmes for people working in jobs involving overtime and extended hours.},

abstract = {Recent advances in connectomics have led to a synthesis of perspectives regarding the brain's functional organization that reconciles classical concepts of localized specialization with an appreciation for properties that emerge from interactions across distributed functional networks. This provides a more comprehensive framework for understanding neural mechanisms of normal cognition and disease. Although fMRI has not become a routine clinical tool, research has already had important influences on clinical concepts guiding diagnosis and patient management. Here we review illustrative examples. Studies demonstrating the network plasticity possible in adults and the global consequences of even focal brain injuries or disease both have had substantial impact on modern concepts of disease evolution and expression. Applications of functional connectomics in studies of clinical populations are challenging traditional disease classifications and helping to clarify biological relationships between clinical syndromes (and thus also ways of extending indications for, or “re-purposing,” current treatments). Large datasets from prospective, longitudinal studies promise to enable the discovery and validation of functional connectomic biomarkers with the potential to identify people at high risk of disease before clinical onset, at a time when treatments may be most effective. Studies of pain and consciousness have catalyzed reconsiderations of approaches to clinical management, but also have stimulated debate about the clinical meaningfulness of differences in internal perceptual or cognitive states inferred from functional connectomics or other physiological correlates. By way of a closing summary, we offer a personal view of immediate challenges and potential opportunities for clinically relevant applications of fMRI-based functional connectomics.},

A narrative synthesis of 15 studies meeting inclusion criteria identified 13 studies that show a circadian impact on the human reward system, with four types of proxy (circadian system biology, downstream circadian rhythms, circadian challenge, and time of day) associated with neural reward activation. Specific reward-related regions/networks subserving this effect included the medial prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum, putamen and default mode network. The circadian effect was observed in measures of both reward anticipation and reward receipt, with more consistent evidence for the latter. Findings are limited by marked heterogeneity across study designs.

abstract = {Despite mounting reports about the negative effects of chronic occupational stress on cognitive and emotional functions, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Recent findings from structural MRI raise the question whether this condition could be associated with a functional uncoupling of the limbic networks and an impaired modulation of emotional stress. To address this, 40 subjects suffering from burnout symptoms attributed to chronic occupational stress and 70 controls were investigated using resting state functional MRI. The participants' ability to up- regulate, down-regulate, and maintain emotion was evaluated by recording their acoustic startle response while viewing neutral and negatively loaded images. Functional connectivity was calculated from amygdala seed regions, using explorative linear correlation analysis. Stressed subjects were less capable of down-regulating negative emotion, but had normal acoustic startle responses when asked to up-regulate or maintain emotion and when no regulation was required. The functional connectivity between the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex correlated with the ability to down-regulate negative emotion. This connectivity was significantly weaker in the burnout group, as was the amygdala connectivity with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the motor cortex, whereas connectivity from the amygdala to the cerebellum and the insular cortex were stronger. In subjects suffering from chronic occupational stress, the functional couplings within the emotion- and stress-processing limbic networks seem to be altered, and associated with a reduced ability to down-regulate the response to emotional stress, providing a biological substrate for a further facilitation of the stress condition.},

Recent findings Functional imaging studies of sleep deprivation have characterized its effects on a number of cognitive domains, the best studied of these being working memory. There is a growing appreciation that it is important to consider interindividual differences in vulnerability to sleep deprivation, task and task difficulty when interpreting imaging results. Our understanding of the role of sleep and the dynamic evolution of offline memory consol idation has benefited greatly from human imaging studies. Both hippocampal-dependent and hippocampal-independent memory systems have been studied. Summary Functional imaging studies contrasting sleep-deprived and well-rested brains provide substantial evidence that sleep is highly important for optimal cognitive function and learning.

abstract = {Common symptoms associated with sleep fragmentation and sleep deprivation include increased objective sleepiness (as measured by the Multiple Sleep Latency Test); decreased psychomotor performance on a number of tasks including tasks involving short term memory, reaction time, or vigilance; and degraded mood. Differences in degree of sleepiness are more related to the degree of sleep loss or fragmentation rather than to the type of sleep disturbance. Both sleep fragmentation and sleep deprivation can exacerbate sleep pathology by increasing the length and pathophysiology of sleep apnea. The incidence of both fragmenting sleep disorders and chronic partial sleep deprivation is very high in our society, and clinicians must be able to recognize and treat Insufficient Sleep Syndrome even when present with other sleep disorders. {\textcopyright} 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Objective The relationship between insomnia symptoms and cognitive performance is unclear, particularly at the population level. We conducted the largest examination of this association to date through analysis of the UK Biobank, a large population-based sample of adults aged 40–69 years. We also sought to determine associations between cognitive performance and self-reported chronotype, sleep medication use and sleep duration. Methods This cross-sectional, population-based study involved 477,529 participants, comprising 133,314 patients with frequent insomnia symptoms (age: 57.4 ± 7.7 years; 62.1{\%} female) and 344,215 controls without insomnia symptoms (age: 56.1 ± 8.2 years; 52.0{\%} female). Cognitive performance was assessed by a touchscreen test battery probing reasoning, basic reaction time, numeric memory, visual memory, and prospective memory. Adjusted models included relevant demographic, clinical, and sleep variables. Results Frequent insomnia symptoms were associated with cognitive impairment in unadjusted models; however, these effects were reversed after full adjustment, leaving those with frequent insomnia symptoms showing statistically better cognitive performance over those without. Relative to intermediate chronotype, evening chronotype was associated with superior task performance, while morning chronotype was associated with the poorest performance. Sleep medication use and both long ({\textgreater}9 h) and short ({\textless}7 h) sleep durations were associated with impaired performance. Conclusions Our results suggest that after adjustment for potential confounding variables, frequent insomnia symptoms may be associated with a small statistical advantage, which is unlikely to be clinically meaningful, on simple neurocognitive tasks. Further work is required to examine the mechanistic underpinnings of an apparent evening chronotype advantage in cognitive performance and the impairment associated with morning chronotype, sleep medication use, and sleep duration extremes.},

abstract = {The primary goal of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) is to delineate the typical patterns of structural and functional connectivity in the healthy adult human brain. However, we know that there are important individual differences in such patterns of connectivity, with evidence that this variability is associated with alterations in important cognitive and behavioral variables that affect real world function. The HCP data will be a critical stepping-off point for future studies that will examine how variation in human structural and functional connectivity play a role in adult and pediatric neurological and psychiatric disorders that account for a huge amount of public health resources. Thus, the HCP is collecting behavioral measures of a range of motor, sensory, cognitive and emotional processes that will delineate a core set of functions relevant to understanding the relationship between brain connectivity and human behavior. In addition, the HCP is using task-fMRI (tfMRI) to help delineate the relationships between individual differences in the neurobiological substrates of mental processing and both functional and structural connectivity, as well as to help characterize and validate the connectivity analyses to be conducted on the structural and functional connectivity data. This paper describes the logic and rationale behind the development of the behavioral, individual difference, and tfMRI batteries and provides preliminary data on the patterns of activation associated with each of the fMRI tasks, at both group and individual levels. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

The present study compared a group (N = 41) that obtained a 9 h reduction of the working week (to a 6 h day) with a comparison group (N = 22) that retained normal work hours. Both groups were constituted of mainly female health care and day care nursery personnel. The experimental group retained full pay and extra personnel were employed to compensate for loss of hours. Questionnaire data were obtained before and 1 year after the change. The data were analyzed using a two-factor ANOVA with the interaction term year*group as the main focus. The results showed a significant interaction of year*group for social factors, sleep quality, mental fatigue, and heart/respiratory complaints, and attitude to work hours. In all cases the experimental group improved whereas the control group did not change. It was concluded that shortened work hours have clear social effects and moderate effects on well-being.},

abstract = {The work-related aspects of coronary heart disease have been studied from the viewpoint of work physiology. The purpose of the following three studies has been to clarify how physical load at work and at leisure affects the risk of developing coronary heart disease. The first study included 120 men, mean age 41 years. They were intensively studied in the laboratory and field conditions, and were classified into four activity categories according to their work and leisure time activities. The results indicated that the highest prevalence rates of obesity, hypertension and angina pectoris symptoms were found among men doing heavy physical work and having no sporting leisure activities. The second study included a postal questionnaire to Finnish municipal employees in 1981 and 1985. Altogether 1999 women and 1419 men responded in both years. Their mean ages at the two survey times were 50.5 and 54.7 years, respectively. The 4-year incidence rates of coronary heart diseases diagnosed by the doctor (myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, coronary insuffiency, hypertension) were the highest in occupations with physical demands, both among women and especially among the men. The incidence rate of hypertension was commonest ({\textgreater}7.0{\%} Among men doing physical work the incidence rate of coronary artery disease was 5.0{\%} The risk ratios for muscular work among men were 5.8 in the 44-49 year age group and 2.2 in the 50-58 year age group. The third project was a case-control study. Seventyseven men who had been clinically examined and who had responded to the previous questionnaire in 1981 were divided into two groups: those diagnosed as having coronary artery disease (cases, n == 42) and those without (controls, n == 35). Both groups had the same mean age of 52 years and had worked in the same occupations during the past five years. The work history given in the questionnaire was assessed from the age of 16 years, using physiological criteria for the classification of the physical load of the given jobs. The results showed that a history of heavy physical work over 20 years was significantly associated with coronary artery disease. These three studies show that the effects of physical load at work on the cardiovascular system increase the risk of people developing coronary heart disease. {\textcopyright} 1989 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.},

Most brain-age research uses structural neuroimaging to index brain volume. However, aging affects multiple aspects of brain structure and function, which can be examined using multimodality neuroimaging. Using UK Biobank, brain-age was modeled in n = 2205 healthy people with T1-weighted MRI, T2-FLAIR, T2∗, diffusion-MRI, task fMRI, and resting-state fMRI. In a held-out healthy validation set (n = 520), chronological age was accurately predicted (r = 0.78, mean absolute error = 3.55 years) using LASSO regression, higher than using any modality separately. Thirty-four neuroimaging phenotypes were deemed informative by the regression (after bootstrapping); predominantly gray-matter volume and white-matter microstructure measures. When applied to new individuals from UK Biobank (n = 14,701), significant associations with multimodality brain-predicted age difference (brain-PAD) were found for stroke history, diabetes diagnosis, smoking, alcohol intake and some, but not all, cognitive measures (corrected p {\textless} 0.05). Multimodality neuroimaging can improve brain-age prediction, and derived brain-PAD values are sensitive to biomedical and lifestyle factors that negatively impact brain and cognitive health.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE - Sleep restriction results in decreased insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in healthy subjects. We hypothesized that sleep duration is also a determinant of insulin sensitivity in patients with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - We studied seven patients (three men, four women) with type 1 diabetes: mean age 44 ± 7 years, BMI 23.5 ± 0.9 kg/m2, and A1C 7.6 ± 0.3{\%}. They were studied once after a night of normal sleep duration and once after a night of only 4 h of sleep. Sleep characteristics were assessed by polysomnography. Insulin sensitivity was measured by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp studies with an infusion of [6,6-2H2]glucose. RESULTS - Sleep duration was shorter in the night with sleep restriction than in the unrestricted night (469 ± 8.5 vs. 222 ± 7.1 min, P = 0.02). Sleep restriction did not affect basal levels of glucose, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs), or endogenous glucose production. Endogenous glucose production during the hyperinsulinemic clamp was not altered during the night of sleep restriction compared with the night of unrestricted sleep (6.2 ± 0.8 vs. 6.9 ± 0.6 $\mu$mol{\textperiodcentered}kg lean body mass-1{\textperiodcentered}min-1, NS). In contrast, sleep restriction decreased the glucose disposal rate during the clamp (25.5 ± 2.6 vs. 22.0 ± 2.1 $\mu$mol{\textperiodcentered}kg lean body mass -1{\textperiodcentered}min-1, P = 0.04), reflecting decreased peripheral insulin sensitivity. Accordingly, sleep restriction decreased the rate of glucose infusion by ∼21{\%} (P = 0.04). Sleep restriction did not alter plasma NEFA levels during the clamp (143 ± 29 vs. 133 ± 29 $\mu$mol/l, NS). CONCLUSIONS - Partial sleep deprivation during a single night induces peripheral insulin resistance in these seven patients with type 1 diabetes. Therefore, sleep duration is a determinant of insulin sensitivity in patients with type 1 diabetes. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the American Diabetes Association.},

Individuals on a rotating three-shift or similar system work the night shift at the low phase of circadian rhythm. On retiring to bed in the morning they fall asleep rapidly but are prematurely awakened by their circadian rhythm and exhibit severe sleepiness and reduced performance capacity. In connection with the morning shift the circadian psychophysiology makes it difficult to fall a sleep as early needed during the preceding night. Around 0400 to 0500, when the individuals should rise, they have difficulties awakening because of the sleep loss and the circadian rhythm, which at that point is at its lowest. Subsequently, day work is characterized by sleepiness and reduced performance. It should be emphasized that it does not seem possible to improve one's ability to adjust over time, even with permanent night work. Older age and 'morningness' personality are related to higher than average problems in adjusting.},

With every hour that work or educational training started later in the morning, sleep time increased by approximately 20 minutes. Working multiple jobs was associated with the highest odds for sleeping ≤6 hours on weekdays (adjusted OR 1.61, 95{\%} CI 1.44; 1.81).

Reducing the need for multiple jobs may increase sleep time, but economic disincentives from working fewer hours will need to be offset.

Experimental studies indicate that circadian rhythm disruption might specifically accelerate brain aging; thus, we prospectively examined shift-work history at midlife as associated with cognitive function among older women in the Nurses' Health Study. Women reported their history of rotating night-shift work in 1988 and participated in telephone-based cognitive interviews between 1995 and 2001; interviews included 6 cognitive tests that were subsequently repeated 3 times, at 2-year intervals. We focused on shift work through midlife (here, ages 58-68 years) because cognitive decline is thought to begin during this period. Using multivariable-adjusted linear regression, we evaluated mean differences in both "average cognitive status" at older age (averaging cognitive scores from all 4 interviews) and rates of cognitive decline over time across categories of shift-work duration at midlife (none, 1-9, 10-19, or ≥20 years). There was little association between shift work and average cognition in later life or between shift work and cognitive decline.

abstract = {Background and Purpose-Long working hours (LWHs) are a potential risk factor for stroke. The aim of this study was to investigate this association in a large general population cohort. Methods-We used the French population-based cohort, CONSTANCES (Cohorte des Consultants des Centres d'Examens de Sant{\'{e}}), to retrieve information on age, sex, smoking, and working hours from the baseline, self-administered questionnaire. Other cardiovascular risk factors and previous occurrence of stroke were taken from a parallel medical interview. We defined LWH as working time {\textgreater}10 hours daily for at least 50 days per year. Participants with primarily part-time jobs were excluded as were those with stroke before LWH exposure. We used logistic models to estimate the association between LWH and stroke, stratified by age, sex, and occupation. In additional modeling, we excluded subjects whose stroke occurred within 5 years of the first reported work exposure. Results-Among the 143 592 participants in the analyses, there were 1224 (0.9{\%}) strokes, 42 542 (29.6{\%}) reported LWH, and 14 481 (10.1{\%}) reported LWH for 10 years or more. LWH was associated with an increased risk of stroke: adjusted odds ratio of 1.29 (95{\%} CI, 1.11-1.49). Being exposed to LWH for 10 years or more was more strongly associated with stroke, adjusted odds ratio of 1.45 (95{\%} CI, 1.21-1.74). The association showed no differences between men and women but was stronger in white-collar workers under 50 years of age. Conclusions-This large analysis reveals a significant association between stroke and exposure to LWH for 10 years or more. The findings are relevant for individual and global prevention.},

abstract = {Background. Chronic sleep debt is becoming increasingly common and affects millions of people in more-developed countries. Sleep debt is currently believed to have no adverse effect on health. We investigated the effect of sleep debt on metabolic and endocrine functions. Methods. We assessed carbohydrate metabolism, thyrotropic function, activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, and sympathovagal balance in 11 young men after time in bed had been restricted to 4 h per night for 6 nights. We compared the sleep-debt condition with measurements taken at the end of a sleep-recovery period when participants were allowed 12 h in bed per night for 6 nights. Findings. Glucose tolerance was lower in the sleep-debt condition than in the fully rested condition (p {\textless} 0.02), as were thyrotropin concentrations (p {\textless} 0.01). Evening cortisol concentrations were raised (p = 0.0001) and activity of the sympathetic nervous system was increased in the sleep-debt condition (p {\textless} 0.02). Interpretation. Sleep debt has a harmful impact on carbohydrate metabolism and endocrine function. The effects are similar to those seen in normal ageing and, therefore, sleep debt may increase the severity of age-related chronic disorders.},

Here, we describe the relationship between shift work and prevalent asthma in {\textgreater}280,000 UK Biobank participants. Compared to day workers, permanent night shift workers had a higher likelihood of moderate/severe asthma (odds ratio (OR) 1.36 (1.03-1.8)) and all asthma (OR 1.23 (1.03-1.46) after adjustment for known major confounders). The public health implications of this finding are far-reaching due to the high prevalence and co-occurrence of both asthma and shift work.

This review critiqued the emergency service literature (e.g., firefighting, police/law enforcement, defense forces, ambulance/paramedic personnel) that has investigated the effect of sleep restriction on hormonal, inflammatory and psychological responses. Furthermore, it investigated if a psycho-physiological approach can help contextualize the significance of such responses to assist emergency service agencies monitor the health of their personnel. The available literature suggests that sleep restriction across multiple work days can disrupt cytokine and cortisol levels, deteriorate mood and elicit simultaneous physiological and psychological responses. However, research concerning the interaction between such responses is limited and inconclusive. Therefore, it is unknown if a psycho-physiological relationship exists and as a result, it is currently not feasible for agencies to monitor sleep restriction related stress based on psycho-physiological interactions. Sleep restriction does however, appear to be a major stressor contributing to physiological and psychological responses and thus, warrants further investigation.},

abstract = {Introduction: The relationship between insomnia symptoms and cognitive performance is unclear, particularly at the population level. We conducted the largest examination of this association to date through analysis of the UK Biobank, a large population-based sample of adults aged 40-69 yrs. We also sought to determine associations between cognitive performance and self-reported chronotype, sleep medication use, and sleep duration. Methods: This cross-sectional, population-based study involved 477,966 participants, comprising 133,582 with frequent insomnia symptoms (age: 57.4 +/- 7.7 yrs; 62.1{\%} female) and 344,384 controls without (age: 56.1 +/- 8.2 yrs; 51.9{\%} female). Cognitive performance was assessed through a touchscreen test battery probing reasoning, basic reaction time, numeric memory, visual memory and prospective memory. Adjusted linear and logistic regression models included relevant demographic (age, gender, socioeconomic status), clinical (depressive symptoms, psychiatric medication use, BMI) and sleep variables. Results: Insomnia symptoms were associated with cognitive impairment in unadjusted models, however these effects were reversed after full adjustment, leaving those with frequent insomnia symptoms showing statistically better cognitive performance over those without (for reasoning, reaction time, visual memory and prospective memory). Relative to intermediate chronotype, evening chronotype was associated with superior task performance, while morning chronotype was associated with the poorest performance. Sleep medication use and both long ({\textgreater}9hrs) and short ({\textless}7hrs) sleep duration were associated with impaired performance. Conclusion: Our results suggest that frequent insomnia symptoms are not reliably associated with cognitive impairment at the population level after adjustment for relevant confounding variables. Further work is required to examine mechanistic underpinnings of an apparent evening chronotype advantage in cognitive performance, as well as impairment associated with morning chronotype, sleep medication use, and sleep duration extremes.},

abstract = {The project brought together researchers from 9 EU-Countries and resulted in a number of actions, in particular the following: (a) There is an urgent need of defining the concept of flexible working hours, since it has been used in many different and even counterintuitive ways; the most obvious distinction is where the influence over the working hours lies, that is between the "company-based flexibility" and the "individual-oriented flexibility"; (b) The review of the Legislation in force in the 15 European countries shows that the regulation of working times is quite extensive and covers (Council Directive 93/104/EC) almost all the various arrangements of working hours (i.e., part-time, overtime, shift, and night work), but fails to provide for flexibility; (c) According to the data of the Third EU Survey on Working Conditions, longer and "irregular" working hours are in general linked to lower levels of health and well-being; moreover, low (individual) flexibility and high variability of working hours (i.e., company-based flexibility) were consistently associated with poor health and well-being, while low variability combined with high autonomy showed positive effects; (d) Six substudies from different countries demonstrated that flexible working hours vary according to country, economic sector, social status, and gender; overtime is the most frequent form of company-based flexibility but has negative effects on stress, sleep, and social and mental health; individual flexibility alleviates the negative effects of the company-based flexibility on subjective health, safety, and social well-being; (e) The literature review was able to list more than 1,000 references, but it was striking that most of these documents were mainly argumentative with very little empirical data. Thus, one may conclude that there is a large-scale intervention ongoing in our society with almost completely unknown and uncontrolled effects. Consequently, there is a strong need for systematic research and well-controlled actions in order to examine in detail what flexible working hours are considered, what and where are their positive effects, in particular, as concerns autonomy, and what regulation seem most reasonable.},

Prolonged curtailment of nocturnal sleep has been studied for its adverse effect on cognitive functioning and subjective tiredness, but relatively little is known about its effect on mood and physical symptoms. Objective: In order to test whether sleep restriction to 50{\%} of the habitual time over 12 days affects diurnal and day-to-day variation of subjective ratings of mood and physical symptoms, 108 adjectives and statements were self-rated using visual analog scales every 2 h during the waking period. Design: Randomized, 16-day controlled in-laboratory study. Setting: General Clinical Research Center (GCRC). Participants: Forty healthy subjects aged 21-40 years (14 females, 26 males). Intervention: Subjects were randomized to either 4 h of sleep per night (11pm-3am, N=22) or 8 h of sleep per night (11pm-7am, N=18) for 12 consecutive days. Main Outcome Measure: Changes in the factor-derived variables optimism-sociability, tiredness-fatigue, anger-aggression, bodily discomfort, and items constituting bodily discomfort were compared between groups. Results: Optimism-sociability progressively declined over consecutive days of sleep restriction by 15{\%}. Bodily discomfort showed a slight, but significant interindividual increase of 3{\%} across days of sleep restriction due to significant increases of generalized body pain, back pain, and stomach pain. Optimism-sociability and tiredness-fatigue showed diurnal variations with a quadratic function period within each day in both conditions. Conclusion: The data suggest that chronic insufficient sleep may contribute to the onset and amplification of pain and affect health by compromising optimistic outlook and psychosocial functioning. {\textcopyright} 2005 International Association for the Study of Pain.

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES Attention is a cognitive domain that can be severely affected by sleep deprivation. Previous neuroimaging studies have used different attention paradigms and reported both increased and reduced brain activation after sleep deprivation. However, due to large variability in sleep deprivation protocols, task paradigms, experimental designs, characteristics of subject populations, and imaging techniques, there is no consensus regarding the effects of sleep loss on the attending brain. The aim of this meta-analysis was to identify brain activations that are commonly altered by acute total sleep deprivation across different attention tasks. DESIGN Coordinate-based meta-analysis of neuroimaging studies of performance on attention tasks during experimental sleep deprivation. METHODS The current version of the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) approach was used for meta-analysis. The authors searched published articles and identified 11 sleep deprivation neuroimaging studies using different attention tasks with a total of 185 participants, equaling 81 foci for ALE analysis. RESULTS The meta-analysis revealed significantly reduced brain activation in multiple regions following sleep deprivation compared to rested wakefulness, including bilateral intraparietal sulcus, bilateral insula, right prefrontal cortex, medial frontal cortex, and right parahippocampal gyrus. Increased activation was found only in bilateral thalamus after sleep deprivation compared to rested wakefulness. CONCLUSION Acute total sleep deprivation decreases brain activation in the fronto-parietal attention network (prefrontal cortex and intraparietal sulcus) and in the salience network (insula and medial frontal cortex). Increased thalamic activation after sleep deprivation may reflect a complex interaction between the de-arousing effects of sleep loss and the arousing effects of task performance on thalamic activity.},

abstract = {Changes of alertness and cognitive efficiency has been suggested in people whose circadian rhythms are disrupted, e.g. night or shift-workers. Data from field and laboratory studies have demonstrated short-term cognitive disturbances related to circadian rhythm disruption. By contrast, little is known about the long-term consequences of chronic sleep deprivation, as can be observed with shift-work, on cognitive abilities. The present paper is aimed at evaluating, on a large cross-sectional sample of workers, the long-term influence of shift-work on verbal memory and speed performances. Participants were 3237 workers aged 32, 42, 52, and 62 years of various occupational statuses included in the VISAT (Aging, Health and Work) cohort. Data collected by questionnaires included items on working hours and shift-work and sleep disorders. Cognitive abilities were assessed using neuropsychological tests. Current male shift-workers had lower cognitive performance than never exposed workers. In the same population, memory performance tended to decrease with increasing shift-work duration. Among former shift-workers, the cognitive performance of the participant having stopped shiftwork more than 4 years ago seemed to be increased, suggesting a possible reversibility of effects. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that cognitive functioning tends to be impaired by a long-term exposure to SW. As found by other authors, neuropsychological performance tends to decrease with the increases in the duration of exposure to SW.},

Summary of relevent findings:

Previous study found that "relative to all other waking activities, paid work time was the primary waking activity exchanged for sleep". In this study they isolate the groups that show a sicgnificant increase in sleep duration across survey years either on weekdays or weekends, i.e. employed adults, full time students and retirees (interestingly not for those who are unemployed or not in the labour force). The change is predominantly explained by respondents retiring eariler in the evening: participants seem more willing to trade waking activities for sleep. The results also suggests taht increasing online opportunities to work, learn, bank, shop and perform administrative duties freed up time that likely contributed to increased sleep duration. 

Relevance:

- Employed vs Unemployed adults showed 'better' sleep patterns with time: could be tied to better work/life balance. Would have to see if this subsection (i.e. Employed adults) are looked at directly, as the abstract lists reitree + students in the same category so the above couldn't hold - but different group could be exhibiting similar effects due to different factors!
- Interesting: Overall sleep duration increased, due to a combination of a decline in short sleep (-0.44{\%}) and an increase in long sleep (+0.48{\%}).},

Studies adjusting for body mass index (BMI) had smaller associations, albeit significant. Relationships were inconsistent with respect to age, medication, and sex. Depression was related to CRP and IL-6 among patients with cardiac disease or cancer. CONCLUSIONS:: Depression and CRP, IL-1, and IL-6 are positively associated in clinical and community samples and BMI is implicated as a mediating/moderating factor. Continuity in clinic- and community-based samples suggests there is a dose-response relationship between depression and these inflammatory markers, lending strength to the contention that the cardiac (or cancer) risk conferred by depression is not exclusive to patient populations. Available evidence is consistent with three causal pathways: depression to inflammation, inflammation to depression, and bidirectional relationships.

abstract = {Adverse health behaviors and obesity are key determinants of major chronic diseases. Evidence on work-related determinants of these behavioral risk factors is inconclusive, and comparative studies are especially lacking. We aimed to examine the associations between job strain, working overtime, adverse health behaviors, and obesity among 45-60-year-old white-collar employees of the Whitehall II Study from London (n = 3397), Helsinki Health Study (n = 6070), and the Japanese Civil Servants Study (n = 2213). Comparable data from all three cohorts were pooled, and logistic regression analysis was used, stratified by cohort and sex. Models were adjusted for age, occupational class, and marital status. Outcomes were unhealthy food habits, physical inactivity, heavy drinking, smoking, and obesity. In London, men reporting passive work were more likely to be physically inactive. A similar association was repeated among women in Helsinki. Additionally, high job strain was associated with physical inactivity among men in London and women in Helsinki. In London, women reporting passive work were less likely to be heavy drinkers and smokers. In Japan, men working overtime reported less smoking, whereas those with high job strain were more likely to smoke. Among men in Helsinki the association between working overtime and non-smoking was also suggested, but it reached statistical significance in the age-adjusted model only. Obesity was associated with working overtime among women in London. In conclusion, job strain and working overtime had some, albeit mostly weak and inconsistent, associations with adverse health behaviors and obesity in these middle-aged white-collar employee cohorts from Britain, Finland, and Japan. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In the UK Biobank, we examined associations of current (N = 272,214) and lifetime (N = 70,480) night shift work exposure with type 2 diabetes risk (6,770 and 1,191 prevalent cases, respectively). For 180,704 and 44,141 unrelated participants of European ancestry (4,002 and 726 cases, respectively)with genetic data,we assessed whether shift work exposure modified the relationship between a genetic risk score (comprising 110 single-nucleotide polymorphisms) for type 2 diabetes and prevalent diabetes. RESULTS Compared with day workers, all current night shift workerswere at highermultivariable- A djusted odds for type 2 diabetes (none or rare night shifts: Odds ratio [OR] 1.15 [95{\%} CI 1.05-1.26]; some nights: OR 1.18 [95{\%} CI 1.05-1.32]; and usual nights: OR 1.44 [95{\%}CI 1.19-1.73]), except current permanent night shiftworkers (OR 1.09 [95{\%} CI 0.93-1.27]). Considering a person's lifetime work schedule and compared with never shift workers, workingmore night shifts permonthwas associatedwith higher type 2 diabetes odds ({\textless}3/month: OR 1.24 [95{\%} CI 0.90-1.68]; ≤3/month: OR 1.11 [95{\%} CI 0.90-1.37]; and {\textgreater}8/month: OR 1.36 [95{\%} CI 1.14-1.62]; Ptrend = 0.001). The association between genetic type 2 diabetes predisposition and type 2 diabetes odds was not modified by shift work exposure. CONCLUSIONS Our findings show that night shift work, especially rotating shiftwork incluDing night shifts, is associated with higher type 2 diabetes odds and that the number of night shifts worked per month appears most relevant for type 2 diabetes odds. Also, shift work exposure does not modify genetic risk for type 2 diabetes, a novel finDing that warrants replication.},

abstract = {Sleep disorders in physicians who perform shift work can result in increased risks of health problems that negatively impact performance and patient safety. Even those who cope well with shift work are likely to suffer from sleep disorders. The aim of this manuscript is to discuss possible causes, contributing factors and consequences of sleep disorders in physicians and to identify measures that can improve adaptation to shift work and treatment strategies for shift work-associated sleep disorders. The risk factors that influence the development of sleep disorders in physicians are numerous and include genetic factors (15 {\%} of the population), age ({\textgreater} 50 years), undiagnosed sleep apnea,, alcohol abuse as well as multiple stress factors inherent in clinical duties (including shift work), research, teaching and family obligations. Several studies have reported an increased risk for medical errors in sleep-deprived physicians. Shift workers have an increased risk for psychiatric and cardiovascular diseases and shift work may also be a contributing factor to cancer. A relationship has been reported not only with sleep deprivation and changes in food intake but also with diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension and coronary heart disease. Nicotine and alcohol consumption are more frequent among shift workers. Increased sickness and accident rates among physicians when commuting (especially after night shifts) have a socioeconomic impact. In order to reduce fatigue and to improve performance, short naps during shiftwork or naps plus caffeine, have been proposed as coping strategies; however, napping during adverse circadian phases is less effective, if not impossible when unable to fall asleep. Bright and blue light supports alertness during a night shift. After shiftwork, direct sunlight exposure to the retina can be avoided by using dark sunglasses or glasses with orange lenses for commuting home. The home environment for daytime sleeping after a night shift should be very dark to allow endogenous melatonin secretion, which is a night signal and supports continuous sleep. Sleep disorders can be treated with timed light exposure, as well as behavioral and environmental strategies to compensate for sleep deprivation. Fatigue due to sleep deprivation can only be systematically treated with sleep.},

abstract = {Sleep loss and circadian disruption - a state of misalignment between physiological functions and imposed sleep/wake behavior - supposedly play central roles in the etiology of shift work-related pathologies [1-4]. Circadian entrainment is, however, highly individual [5], resulting in different chronotypes [6, 7]. Chronotype in turn modulates the effects of working times: compared to late chronotypes, earlier ones sleep worse and shorter and show higher levels of circadian misalignment during night shifts, while late types experience more sleep and circadian disruption than early types when working morning shifts [8]. To promote sleep and reduce the mismatch between circadian and working time, we implemented a chronotype-adjusted (CTA) shift schedule in a factory. We abolished the most strenuous shifts for extreme chronotypes (i.e., mornings for late chronotypes, nights for early ones) and examined whether sleep duration and quality, social jetlag [9, 10], wellbeing, subjective stress perception, and satisfaction with leisure time improved in this schedule. Intermediate chronotypes (quartiles 2 and 3) served as a control group, still working morning (6:00-14:00), evening (14:00-22:00), and night (22:00-6:00) shifts, with two strenuous shifts (out of twelve per month) replaced by evening ones. We observed a significant increase of self-reported sleep duration and quality, along with increased wellbeing ratings on workdays among extreme chronotypes. The CTA schedule reduced overall social jetlag by 1 hr, did not alter stress levels, and increased satisfaction with leisure time (early types only). Chronotype-based schedules thus can reduce circadian disruption and improve sleep; potential long-term effects on health and economic indicators need to be elucidated in future studies.},

abstract = {In many sleep-deprivation studies investigating the effects of sleep loss on performance , mood was also investigated using either the profile of mood states (POMS) or visual analog scales (VAS), administered at regular intervals during the sleep-deprivation period or at the beginning and end of the study periods. 1-7 Generally, results have shown a significant negative effect of sleep loss on most mood states. Dinges et al, 1 for instance, reported an increasing mood disturbance over 7 days of sleep restriction in a controlled laboratory setting, using 3 daily mood recordings with the POMS and VAS questionnaires. Moreover, subjects' responses on an open-ended daily log revealed increasing complaints concerning cog-nitive and emotional difficulties. At the same time, available studies offer no formal explanation for this relationship. One objective of the present study is to offer a theoretical explanation of the sleep-mood relationship. A second objective concerns the fact that recent advances in emotion research indicate that emotion is fundamentally a response to changing life circumstances, ie, it must be interpreted in the context of psychologically relevant events at work or home, eg, Affective Events Theory. 8 Frijda 9 noted thus that "emotions have an object, they are about something{\ldots} One is happy about something, angry at someone, afraid of something." 9p381 Measuring emotional states at random times during the day to the exclusion of precipitating events (ie, the current practice in available studies on sleep and emotion), suffers thus from a method-ologic weakness. A superior methodology should incorporate affective events in the study design, measuring the effect of sleep loss on emotional reaction to psychologically relevant events. The second objective of this study is, therefore, to test the effect of sleep loss on intensity of emotional reaction following relevant events during the day. The theoretical link between sleep and emotion is provided by Zohar et al, 10 whose cognitive-energy model posits that, because disruptive or challenging circumstances require effortful self-regulation, the levels of energy available for behavior self-regulation will influence intensity of emotional reaction. This model relates to extensive literature concerning feedback-control models of behavior 11,12 and cognitive models of emotion. 13 Jointly, these models and accompanying research indicate that feedback information signifying progress toward a valued goal 11,13 or a satisfactory rate of progress in reference to some temporal criterion 14,15 promotes positive emotion, whereas information signify-Study objectives: This study investigated the relationship between sleep loss and emotional reactivity in medical residents. We hypothesized that this relationship is shaped by the effect of sleep loss on cog-nitive-energy resources required for coping with goal-disruptive events or for capitalizing on new opportunities offered by goal-enhancing events. Settings: 15 medical wards in 4 large hospitals in Israel. Participants: 78 medical residents, 67{\%} men, aged 26 to 39 years. Design: Actigraphic sleep-wake cycles were measured for 5-to 7-day periods, surrounding nightshifts, every 6 months, covering the first 2 years of residency. During each study period, emotional reactivity was investigated using the experience-sampling methodology by which residents received 3 phone calls at random times during their working day for 3 consecutive days. These calls reminded them to fill out brief questionnaires concerning change of circumstances over the previous 15 minutes and to rate their emotional response to these circumstances using the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Scales. Fatigue at those times was measured by a subscale of the Profile of Mood States. Measurements and Results: Multilevel regression analysis was used to determine the influence of sleep duration and sleep fragmentation on the emotional reactions to goal-disruptive and goal-enhancing daytime events. We found that sleep loss intensified negative emotions and fatigue following daytime disruptive events, while positive emotion was mitigated following goal-enhancing events. Sleep loss also resulted in an overall elevated baseline for positive emotion. Conclusions: Sleep loss amplifies the negative emotive effects of dis-ruptive events while reducing the positive effect of goal-enhancing events. Methodologically, the study highlights the utility and advantages of event-level analysis as opposed to the current practice of random sampling of emotion states during waking hours, disregarding contextual factors associated with purposeful, goal-oriented behavior episodes.

With a focus on neuroimaging studies, we review the consequences of SD on attention and working memory, positive and negative emotion, and hippocampal learning. We explore how this evidence informs our mechanistic understanding of the known changes in cognition and emotion associated with SD, and the insights it provides regarding clinical conditions associated with sleep disruption.},

Summary of relevent findings:

Previous study found that "relative to all other waking activities, paid work time was the primary waking activity exchanged for sleep". In this study they isolate the groups that show a sicgnificant increase in sleep duration across survey years either on weekdays or weekends, i.e. employed adults, full time students and retirees (interestingly not for those who are unemployed or not in the labour force). The change is predominantly explained by respondents retiring eariler in the evening: participants seem more willing to trade waking activities for sleep. The results also suggests taht increasing online opportunities to work, learn, bank, shop and perform administrative duties freed up time that likely contributed to increased sleep duration. 

Relevance:

- Employed vs Unemployed adults showed 'better' sleep patterns with time: could be tied to better work/life balance. Would have to see if this subsection (i.e. Employed adults) are looked at directly, as the abstract lists reitree + students in the same category so the above couldn't hold - but different group could be exhibiting similar effects due to different factors!
- Interesting: Overall sleep duration increased, due to a combination of a decline in short sleep (-0.44{\%}) and an increase in long sleep (+0.48{\%}).},

abstract = {In recent years, theoretical models of the sleep and circadian system developed in laboratory settings have been adapted to predict fatigue and, by inference, performance. This is typically done using the timing of prior sleep and waking or working hours as the primary input and the time course of the predicted variables as the primary output. The aim of these models is to provide employers, unions and regulators with quantitative information on the likely average level of fatigue, or risk, associated with a given pattern of work and sleep with the goal of better managing the risk of fatigue-related errors and accidents/incidents. The first part of this review summarises the variables known to influence workplace fatigue and draws attention to the considerable variability attributable to individual and task variables not included in current models. The second part reviews the current fatigue models described in the scientific and technical literature and classifies them according to whether they predict fatigue directly by using the timing of prior sleep and wake (one-step models) or indirectly by using work schedules to infer an average sleep-wake pattern that is then used to predict fatigue (two-step models). The third part of the review looks at the current use of fatigue models in field settings by organizations and regulators. Given their limitations it is suggested that the current generation of models may be appropriate for use as one element in a fatigue risk management system. The final section of the review looks at the future of these models and recommends a standardised approach for their use as an element of the 'defenses-in-depth' approach to fatigue risk management. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In the last decade, explosive growth regarding functional connectome studies has been observed. Accumulating knowledge has significantly contributed to our understanding of the brain's functional network architectures in health and disease. With the development of innovative neuroimaging techniques, the establishment of large brain datasets and the increasing accumulation of published findings, functional connectomic research has begun to move into the era of “big data”, which generates unprecedented opportunities for discovery in brain science and simultaneously encounters various challenging issues, such as data acquisition, management and analyses. Big data on the functional connectome exhibits several critical features: high spatial and/or temporal precision, large sample sizes, long-term recording of brain activity, multidimensional biological variables (e.g., imaging, genetic, demographic, cognitive and clinic) and/or vast quantities of existing findings. We review studies regarding functional connectomics from a big data perspective, with a focus on recent methodological advances in state-of-the-art image acquisition (e.g., multiband imaging), analysis approaches and statistical strategies (e.g., graph theoretical analysis, dynamic network analysis, independent component analysis, multivariate pattern analysis and machine learning), as well as reliability and reproducibility validations. We highlight the novel findings in the application of functional connectomic big data to the exploration of the biological mechanisms of cognitive functions, normal development and aging and of neurological and psychiatric disorders. We advocate the urgent need to expand efforts directed at the methodological challenges and discuss the direction of applications in this field.},

abstract = {C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute inflammatory protein that increases up to 1,000-fold at sites of infection or inflammation. CRP is produced as a homopentameric protein, termed native CRP (nCRP), which can irreversibly dissociate at sites of inflammation and infection into five separate monomers, termed monomeric CRP (mCRP). CRP is synthesized primarily in liver hepatocytes but also by smooth muscle cells, macrophages, endothelial cells, lymphocytes, and adipocytes. Evidence suggests that estrogen in the form of hormone replacement therapy influences CRP levels in the elderly. Having been traditionally utilized as a marker of infection and cardiovascular events, there is now growing evidence that CRP plays important roles in inflammatory processes and host responses to infection including the complement pathway, apoptosis, phagocytosis, nitric oxide (NO) release, and the production of cytokines, particularly interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$. Unlike more recent publications, the findings of early work on CRP can seem somewhat unclear and at times conflicting since it was often not specified which particular CRP isoform was measured or utilized in experiments and whether responses attributed to nCRP were in fact possibly due to dissociation into mCRP or lipopolysaccharide contamination. In addition, since antibodies for mCRP are not commercially available, few laboratories are able to conduct studies investigating the mCRP isoform. Despite these issues and the fact that most CRP research to date has focused on vascular disorders, there is mounting evidence that CRP isoforms have distinct biological properties, with nCRP often exhibiting more anti-inflammatory activities compared to mCRP. The nCRP isoform activates the classical complement pathway, induces phagocytosis, and promotes apoptosis. On the other hand, mCRP promotes the chemotaxis and recruitment of circulating leukocytes to areas of inflammation and can delay apoptosis. The nCRP and mCRP isoforms work in opposing directions to inhibit and induce NO production, respectively. In terms of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, mCRP increases interleukin-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 production, whereas nCRP has no detectable effect on their levels. Further studies are needed to expand on these emerging findings and to fully characterize the differential roles that each CRP isoform plays at sites of local inflammation and infection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The link between work distress and negative mental health outcome is an emergent topic in the scientific literature. The studies that evaluated the risk of work-related psychopathologies in the different job sectors have obtained so far controversial and inconclusive results. The identification, by means of standardized evaluation tools, of the work activities at higher risk of poor mental health is a relevant target for the occupational psychiatry and medicine. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between the psychosocial work conditions and work related psychiatric disturbances and to verify the relationship between the higher pathogenic effect of work and specific job activities. PARTICIPANTS: A six-month diagnostic trial was conducted on 234 patients (35.4{\%} women and 64.6{\%} men). METHODS: Psychiatric diagnoses were according to DSM-IV criteria; anxious and depressive dimensions were studied by means of Hamilton-Anxiety-Scale and Hamilton Scale for Depression; psychosocial work environments and bio-psycho-social features were measured by Naples-Questionnaire of Work Distress. Groups with higher and lower work-related pathogenesis were compared and their distribution among specific job activities was evaluated. RESULTS: Mood disorders were strongly linked to negative work environment. Patients with severe bullying obtained higher scores on Hamilton-Anxiety-Scale and Hamilton Scale for Depression than those with lower work-pathogenesis. The highest scores on Naples-Questionnaire of Work Distress were related to mood disorders, to poorer bio-psycho-social functioning and to higher work etiology. No significant relationship between work activities and work-related psychopathologies was found. CONCLUSION: Workplace bullying is predictive of work-related psychiatric disturbances with more severe clinical features and bio-psycho-social consequences. No significant differences were found about the relationship between work-related psychopathologies and work activities. {\textcopyright} 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract = {Most people will at some point experience not getting enough sleep over a period of days, weeks, or months. However, the effects of this kind of everyday sleep restriction on high-level cognitive abilities - such as the ability to store and recall information in memory, solve problems, and communicate - remain poorly understood. In a global sample of over 10000 people, we demonstrated that cognitive performance, measured using a set of 12 well-established tests, is impaired in people who reported typically sleeping less, or more, than 7-8 hours per night - which was roughly half the sample. Crucially, performance was not impaired evenly across all cognitive domains. Typical sleep duration had no bearing on short-term memory performance, unlike reasoning and verbal skills, which were impaired by too little, or too much, sleep. In terms of overall cognition, a self-reported typical sleep duration of 4 hours per night was equivalent to aging 8 years. Also, sleeping more than usual the night before testing (closer to the optimal amount) was associated with better performance, suggesting that a single night's sleep can benefit cognition. The relationship between sleep and cognition was invariant with respect to age, suggesting that the optimal amount of sleep is similar for all adult age groups, and that sleep-related impairments in cognition affect all ages equally. These findings have significant real-world implications, because many people, including those in positions of responsibility, operate on very little sleep and may suffer from impaired reasoning, problem-solving, and communications skills on a daily basis.},

abstract = {Study objective-To investigate the associations of various types of employment with six self reported health indicators, taking into account the part played by demographic variables, individual working conditions and four ecological indicators at the country level. Design-Cross sectional survey (struc-tured interview) of a sample of the active population of 15 European countries aged 15 years or over. Main independent variables were nine types of employment categorised as follows: small employers, full and part time permanent employees, full and part time fixed term employees, full and part time sole traders and full and part time temporary contracts. Main outcome measures were three self reported health related outcomes (job satisfaction, health related absenteeism, and stress) and three self reported health problems (overall fatigue, backache, and muscular pains). Logistic regression and multilevel models were used in the analyses. Setting-15 countries of the European Union. Participants-15 146 employed persons aged 15 or over. Main results-Precarious employment was consistently and positively associated with job dissatisfaction but negatively associated with absenteeism and stress (as compared with full time permanent workers). Fatigue, backache and muscular pains also tended to be positively associated with precarious employment, particularly with full time precarious employment. Small employers reported high percentages of stress and fatigue, but absenteeism was relatively low. Sole traders generally reported high percentages of all outcomes, except for absenteeism, which was low. For each type of employment (except temporary contracts), full time workers tended to report worse health outcomes than part time workers. Patterns were generally consistent across countries. Associations persisted after adjustment for individual level working conditions and were not modified by country level variables. Conclusions-This study is the first to examine the relations between various types of employment and six health related indicators for all 15 member states of the European Union. Suggestive patterns worthy of further exploration have been found. Standardised definitions of types of underemployment and health related outcomes , more potent epidemiological designs and the inclusion of socioeconomic information (for example, social security systems, incapacity benefit schemes) at the regional level are proposed for inclusion in further research. (J Epidemiol Community Health 2000;54:494-501) In the two past decades an increasing number of studies have found that unemployment is strongly associated with adverse health indicators such as higher mortality, unhealthy symptoms , unfavourable lifestyles or more psychological problems at both individual and ecological levels. 1-4 Although unemployment is likely to be one of the major long term social problems that Europe is facing, European countries are increasingly showing new forms of work organisation and flexible employment. These socioeconomic changes are leading to high numbers of various types of underemploy-ment, including involuntary part time employment and insecure employment, together with high unemployment rates. 5 In the European Union (EU), precarious employment (fixed term contracts and temporary work) accounts for 15{\%} of paid employment. The highest percentages are found in Spain (40{\%}) and France (22{\%}) while the lowest levels are found in Luxembourg and Austria (9{\%}). 6 Knowledge of the impact of these new forms of employment on health indicators is very scarce. 2 7-9 An EU report found that employees with precarious contracts, and particularly temporary workers, were much more exposed to poor working conditions such as vibrations, loud noise, hazardous products or repetitive tasks. For example, temporary workers work more often than permanent workers in painful or tiring positions (57{\%} compared with 42{\%}), are more exposed to intense noise (38{\%} compared with 29{\%}), and perform repetitive tasks more frequently (46{\%} compared with 36{\%}). 5 In addition, preliminary studies at the national level have begun to analyse the eVects of precarious work on some health outcomes and have suggested that new types of contracts may be linked to ill health. In Spain and France, for example, temporary workers showed much higher levels of occupational accidents as compared with permanent workers. 10 11 Many questions still remain unanswered regarding the potential associations between},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We sought to investigate the effects of sleep loss on high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. BACKGROUND: Concentrations of high-sensitivity CRP are predictive of future cardiovascular morbidity. In epidemiologic studies, short sleep duration and sleep complaints have also been associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity. Two studies were undertaken to examine the effect of acute total and short-term partial sleep deprivation on concentrations of high-sensitivity CRP in healthy human subjects. METHODS: In Experiment 1, 10 healthy adult subjects stayed awake for 88 continuous hours. Samples of high-sensitivity CRP were collected every 90 min for 5 consecutive days, encompassing the vigil. In Experiment 2, 10 subjects were randomly assigned to either 8.2 h (control) or 4.2 h (partial sleep deprivation) of nighttime sleep for 10 consecutive days. Hourly samples of high-sensitivity CRP were taken during a baseline night and on day 10 of the study protocol. RESULTS: The CRP concentrations increased during both total and partial sleep deprivation conditions, but remained stable in the control condition. Systolic blood pressure increased across deprivation in Experiment 1, and heart rate increased in Experiment 2. CONCLUSIONS: Both acute total and short-term partial sleep deprivation resulted in elevated high-sensitivity CRP concentrations, a stable marker of inflammation that has been shown to be predictive of cardiovascular morbidity. We propose that sleep loss may be one of the ways that inflammatory processes are activated and contribute to the association of sleep complaints, short sleep duration, and cardiovascular morbidity observed in epidemiologic surveys. {\textcopyright} 2004 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {Background: Analysis of the human connectome using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) started in the mid-1990s and attracted increasing attention in attempts to discover the neural underpinnings of human cognition and neurological disorders. In general, brain connectivity patterns from fMRI data are classified as statistical dependencies (functional connectivity) or causal interactions (effective connectivity) among various neural units. Computational methods, especially graph theory-based methods, have recently played a significant role in understanding brain connectivity architecture. Objectives: Thanks to the emergence of graph theoretical analysis, the main purpose of the current paper is to systematically review how brain properties can emerge through the interactions of distinct neuronal units in various cognitive and neurological applications using fMRI. Moreover, this article provides an overview of the existing functional and effective connectivity methods used to construct the brain network, along with their advantages and pitfalls. Methods: In this systematic review, the databases Science Direct, Scopus, arXiv, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, PsycINFO, PubMed, and SpringerLink are employed for exploring the evolution of computational methods in human brain connectivity from 1990 to the present, focusing on graph theory. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool was used to assess the risk of bias in individual studies.Results: Our results show that graph theory and its implications in cognitive neuroscience have attracted the attention of researchers since 2009 (as the Human Connectome Project launched), because of their prominent capability in characterizing the behavior of complex brain systems. Although graph theoretical approach can be generally applied to either functional or effective connectivity patterns during rest or task performance, to date, most articles have focused on the resting-state functional connectivity. Conclusions: This review provides an insight into how to utilize graph theoretical measures to make neurobiological inferences regarding the mechanisms underlying human cognition and behavior as well as different brain disorders.},

abstract = {Human sleep schedules vary widely across countries. We investigated whether these variations were related to differences in social factors, Morningness-Eveningness (ME) preference, or the natural light-dark cycle by contrasting the sleep duration and timing of young adults (age: 18-35 years) on work and free days in Singapore (n = 1898) and the UK (n = 837). On work days, people in Singapore had later bedtimes, but wake times were similar to the UK sample, resulting in shorter sleep duration. In contrast, sleep duration on free days did not differ between the two countries. Shorter sleep on work days, without compensatory extra long sleep hours on free days, suggest greater demands from work and study in Singapore. While the two samples differed slightly in ME preference, the associations between eveningness preference and greater extension in sleep duration as well as delays in sleep timing on free days were similar in the two countries. Thus, differences in ME preference did not account for the differences in sleep schedules between the two countries. The greater variability in the photoperiod in the UK was not associated with more prominent seasonal changes in sleep patterns compared to Singapore. Furthermore, in the UK, daylight saving time did not alter sleep schedules relative to clock time. Collectively, these findings suggest that differences in social demands, primarily from work or study, could account for the observed differences in sleep schedules between countries, and that in industrialized societies, social zeitgebers, which typically involve exposure to artificial light, are major determinants of sleep schedules. {\textcopyright} 2014 Lo, Leong, Loh, Dijk and Chee.},

@article{Gujar2011,
abstract = {Although the impact of sleep on cognitive function is increasingly well established, the role of sleep in modulating affective brain processes remains largely uncharacterized. Using a face recognition task, here we demonstrate an amplified reactivity to anger and fear emotions across the day, without sleep. However, an intervening nap blocked and even reversed this negative emotional reactivity to anger and fear while conversely enhancing ratings of positive (happy) expressions. Most interestingly, only those subjects who obtained rapid eye movement (REM) sleep displayed this remodulation of affective reactivity for the latter 2 emotion categories. Together, these results suggest that the evaluation of specific human emotions is not static across a daytime waking interval, showing a progressive reactivity toward threat-related negative expressions. However, an episode of sleep can reverse this predisposition, with REM sleep depotentiating negative reactivity toward fearful expressions while concomitantly facilitating recognition and ratings of reward-relevant positive expressions. These findings support the view that sleep, and specifically REM neurophysiology, may represent an important factor governing the optimal homeostasis of emotional brain regulation.},

@misc{Banks2007,
abstract = {Adequate sleep is essential for general healthy functioning. This paper reviews recent research on the effects of chronic sleep restriction on neurobehavioral and physiological functioning and discusses implications for health and lifestyle. Restricting sleep below an individual's optimal time in bed (TIB) can cause a range of neurobehavioral deficits, including lapses of attention, slowed working memory, reduced cognitive throughput, depressed mood, and perseveration of thought. Neurobehavioral deficits accumulate across days of partial sleep loss to levels equivalent to those found after 1 to 3 nights of total sleep loss. Recent experiments reveal that following days of chronic restriction of sleep duration below 7 hours per night, significant daytime cognitive dysfunction accumulates to levels comparable to that found after severe acute total sleep deprivation. Additionally, individual variability in neurobehavioral responses to sleep restriction appears to be stable, suggesting a trait-like (possibly genetic) differential vulnerability or compensatory changes in the neurobiological systems involved in cognition. A causal role for reduced sleep duration in adverse health outcomes remains unclear, but laboratory studies of healthy adults subjected to sleep restriction have found adverse effects on endocrine functions, metabolic and inflammatory responses, suggesting that sleep restriction produces physiological consequences that may be unhealthy.},

@article{Rae2018,
abstract = {Motor actions can be facilitated or hindered by psychophysiological states of readiness, to guide rapid adaptive action. Cardiovascular arousal is communicated by cardiac signals conveying the timing and strength of individual heartbeats. Here, we tested how these interoceptive signals facilitate control of motor impulsivity. Participants performed a stop signal task, in which stop cues were delivered at different time points within the cardiac cycle: at systole when the heart contracts (T-wave peak, approximately 300 ms following the R-wave), or at diastole between heartbeats (R-wave peak). Response inhibition was better at systole, indexed by a shorter stop signal reaction time (SSRT), and longer stop signal delay (SSD). Furthermore, parasympathetic control of cardiovascular tone, and subjective sensitivity to interoceptive states, predicted response inhibition efficiency, although these cardiovascular and interoceptive correlations did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. This suggests that response inhibition capacity is influenced by interoceptive physiological cues, such that people are more likely to express impulsive actions during putative states of lower cardiovascular arousal, when frequency and strength of cardiac afferent signalling is reduced.},
